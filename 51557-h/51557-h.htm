<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="100" height="99" alt="S"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">So</span>
we left the old grey
Horse at the <i>Tabard</i>, and
set forth a-foot, my Mother
and me, for <i>London Bridge</i>:
I looking right and left
for a Glimpse of the great, broad River.
But no Water could we see; and the
Ways were thronged with Men, Horses,
Carts, Wagons, Flocks of Sheep, and
Droves of Oxen, pressing along between
Stalls set out with all manner of Cates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
Anon we come to a big Gateway, with
its Portcullis-teeth grinning over our
Heads; and a-top of this Gateway, that
was flanked with Turrets, and spanned
the Road, were ever so many round,
dark Objects, set on Poles, leaning this
Way and that; and my Mother shuddered
when she saw them, and told me
they were Traitors' Heads. But between
us and this Gateway lay a Draw-bridge,
the which, as we crossed, gave us a
Glimpse of the broad <i>Thames</i>, all a-blaze
in the Sun. I pluckt at my Mother's
Sleeve, without speaking, and we looked
over the Parapet, and could see Boats
ducking and diving under a Row of
Houses right across the River, some of
'em six Stories high, with Balconies and
projecting Gables, looking ready to topple
into the Water, that rushed onward with
tremendous Force, eddying and foaming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
among the Arches. Then I noted at the
Foot of each Pier, strange Projections of
Timber-work, and askt my Mother what
they were, and she could not tell me.
But a Man that overheard me said they
were called Sterlings, and were strong
Piles of Wood driven into the Bed of
the River. Also he told me the Bridge
was sixty Feet above the Water, and
that its Founder, <i>Peter</i> of <i>Colechurch</i>, lay
y-buried in the Chapel on the Bridge;
and more he would have added but for
the Interposure of my Mother, who said,
"Come, Child, we linger," and drew me
away. Then we passed under the Gateway,
which was also a Kind of Guard-house,
and Toll-gate; and, quod she,
"Now thou art on <i>London Bridge</i>." But
I should never have found it out; for to
all Seeming, we were in midst of an ill-paved,
exceeding narrow Strete, only some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
twelve Feet across, with Frippery-shops,
and such-like on either Side. A great,
o'erloaded Wagon that went first, cleared
the Way for us, filling the Space all
across; but anon it meeteth another
Wagon, even higher than itself, with a
Terrier barking a-top; and, the one
essaying to pass the other, their Headgear
got entangled in the Outworks of the
upper Stories of two opposite Houses,
and I saw the Terrier jump into an
Attick Window, and presently run forth
of the Shop below. Then the Wagoners
chode and reviled, for one of 'em must
needs back off the Bridge, and some
Sheep and Oxen were coming up behind;
and the Foot-passengers jostled and jibed,
and Shopkeepers looked forth of their
Doors, and Wives and Maids from their
Lattices, and Swarms of quick-eyed mischievous
favoured Lads peered forth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
every Bulk; and my Mother cried, "Oh!
weary on them! we may bide here all
Night!" ... when, looking hard on
the Shop to our left, she sayth, "Why
here's the <i>Golden Fleece</i>!"</p>

<p>And so we made bold to enter, between
a few Rolls of brown and gray Cloth;
and found Master <i>Hewet</i> seated behind
a Desk, holding a Pen, but not using
it, discoursing with a sober-apparelled
Friend, and ever and anon casting a
quiet amused Look at the Turmoil on
the Bridge. He was what I then counted
a middle-aged, but should now reckon a
youngish Man, somewhere betwixt thirty
and forty Years of Age, of a good Presence
and a piercing but pleasant Eye; and with
that in his Carriage and Looks that discovered
he had Something within him
beyond the common, that tended to excite
Affection and Veneration. So soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
as his Eye lighted pleasantly upon us,
"Surely, thou art the Widow <i>Osborne</i>!"
quod he to my Mother, "and this, by
his Favour, I am sure is the Son of
mine old School-mate. He will, I trust,
prove of as good Conditions."</p>

<p>And, putting down his Pen, he quickly
led the Way into a pleasant Chamber at
the Back, o'erlooking the River, wherein,
a watering of some Flowers on the Window-sill,
was a middle-aged Gentlewoman,
clad in Black, of a benign Aspect, a mild
hazel Eye, and a Tinct that had more of
the Pearl than the Peach in it. "Sister
<i>Fraunces</i>," quod Master <i>Hewet</i>, "here
is Mistress <i>Osborne</i>;" whereon the
Gentlewoman turned about and spake
courteouslie unto my Mother, whom she
made to sit down and take Wine and
Spiced-bread; while I, as a mannerly
Youth, stood in Presence of mine Elders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
Then sayth my Mother to Master <i>Hewet</i>,
"I come, Sir, in answer to your considerate
Letter, to put my Boy in your
Charge:&mdash;he's but country-bred, though
a good Lad, and come of a good Stock
... not only born of a Woman, but
taught of a Woman, alas that I should
say so! save for his School-teaching."
"Marry, his Brother-prentice, then, is
one of another Feather," saith Master
<i>Hewet</i>, smiling, "we shall see which turns
out best. Leave your Son with me;
and at the End of a Month or so,
when he hath looked at the Trade a
little, we will decide whether or no to
have him bound." "Alas, Sir!" saith
my Mother, with lengthened Face, "may
not all be done now? I have two small
Children at Home, mine Absence is untimeous,
and Travelling is strange to
me&mdash;I have the Fee ready, the Boy is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
willing, and you cannot choose but be
satisfied with his Conditions, for the
Lad is a good Lad, though 'tis his
Mother that says so."</p>

<p>"Well," saith Master <i>Hewet</i>, after a
little Thought, "the Course is uncommon,
for we mainly like to prove a
Youth and see whether he be likely to
do Good at the Trade, and be a profitable
and desirable Apprentice before we
bind him; but since your Case is in
some Respects singular, it shall be as
you say; for, as it happens, this is one
of the Days on which the Court and
Master sit to bind and enroll 'Prentices."
So forth we went: he making Way for
my Mother, and I following last.</p>

<p>On our Way to <i>Mincheon Lane</i>, we fell
in with an uproarious Rabble, that, with
Shouts, were haling Somewhat through
the Mud, which proved to be a Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
Image; doubtless, just pulled down from
its Niche. The Head was rare carven,
and floridly painted after the Life; but the
Trunk was nothing but a squared Block,
with a Cross-piece for the Shoulders, and
looked pitiful enow, now 'twas despoiled
of its rich Clothing. An Ale-house
Keeper at the Bridge end turned in-doors
with Disgust at the Sight, which some of
the Rabblement noting, they cried out,
"Here's a Bone for you to pick, Sir
<i>Tobias</i>!" and beset his Door. I afterwards
learned he was an ejected Roman
Catholic Parson.</p>

<p>When we reached the <i>Clothworkers'
Hall</i>, the Clerk made out my Indentures;
and then I was taken before the Master
to be enrolled.</p>

<p>My Mother having paid the Fee,
(Spoon-silver they jocosely called it,)
unto Master <i>Hewet</i>, he did not pocket it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
but put it into the Common-box: and
the Business was done; my Master exchanging
some pleasant Words with the
Master of the Company, and the latter
bidding me (in the only Sentence he
spoke to me), mind the Clothworkers'
Motto,&mdash;"<i>My Trust is in God alone</i>."</p>

<p>Then, my Mother and I took Leave of
one another, aside, as 'twere, in the Doorway;
for she was to lie that Night in
<i>Temstrete</i>, at her Cousin <i>Hale's</i>, (who was
a <i>Broughton</i>,) and return to <i>Ashford</i> on the
Morrow. And she kissed me and wept
sore, and sayth, "Ah Son, thou art full
young to be cast out of the Nest ...
fain I were to keep thee: but what
though? Thou canst not always be at
mine Apron-string, and thou hast a brave
Spirit and a good Heart; wherefore,
like <i>Hannah</i>, Wife of <i>Elkanah</i>, I will
entrust my First-born unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
and see what he will do for thee....
And remember, <i>Ned</i>, thou art the Son
of a Gentleman, and think the Eye of
thy Father still upon thee."</p>

<p>Then quod I, in answer to my Mother,
"Cheer up, sweet <i>Mother</i>, I will never
disgrace him nor thee: so give over
thy weeping, lest they should deem the
Tears on my Face to be mine instead of
thine ... don't melt me, <i>Mother</i>, lest
they count me but a Boy, and make
light of our Country Breeding."</p>

<p>"A Boy, indeed! What art thou
more?" quod she, smiling through her
Tears; and with one hearty Kiss and her
Blessing, went her Ways.</p>

<p>On our Return to my Master's House,
he, noting my Hair to be too long for a
'Prentice, (for, indeed, my Mother was
rather vain of it,) gave me a Penny, and
sent me to Master <i>Soper</i> the Barbitonsor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
across the Bridge, to have it clipt. Here
found I a Man having his Beard trimmed,
and another, waiting for his Turn, playing
a Mandoline. Seeing me look forth
of the Lattice on the River, boiling and
splashing below, and the Boats shooting
the Arches and nearly pitching Head
foremost down the Fall, he stayed his
Hand, and told me how many Lives were
lost in those Rapids by the Year. Then I
made bold to ask him what was that great
Fortress with Towers, on the north Bank.</p>

<p>"Thou art a Stranger in <i>London</i>, then,"
saith he, "for every Cockney knows the
<i>Tower</i>, whose foundation Stones were
cemented, they say, with Mortar tempered
with Blood. And truly, Blood
enow hath been spilt within it to bring
a Judgment on its Walls. <i>Henry</i> the
<i>Sixth</i> was murdered in the <i>Tower</i>, <i>George</i>
of <i>Clarence</i> was drowned in the <i>Tower</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
<i>Edward</i> the <i>Fifth</i> and <i>Richard</i> Duke
of <i>York</i>, those pretty Innocents, were
smothered in the <i>Tower</i>, <i>Anne Boleyn</i>
and <i>Katherine Howard</i> were beheaded in
the <i>Tower</i>. And, for all it hath held a
King's Parliament, and is our Citadel of
Defence, a royal Palace for Assemblies,
a Council-house for Treaties, a Treasury
of Crown Jewels, the royal Mint of
Coinage, the prime Conservator of Records,
and the Armoury of warlike Provisions,
yet, for the Tears and the Blood
that have been shed in it, I could say,
Down with it, down with it even unto
the Ground! And methinks its evil
Story is not yet wound up, but that a
dark Cloud hangs over it e'en now.
We shall see! we shall see! Many
an ignoble Man rises aloft, many a
proud Man is brought low. 'Tis time
enough at one's Life's end to sing Gloria.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
Ah! our Bridge Tower, whereof I am
Gate-keeper, hath another guess Foundation
than <i>Cæsar's</i>; for on every one
of its four Corner-stones is graven the
Name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>; <i>deep, but out of Sight</i>."</p>

<p>And he peered into my Face as he
spake that Saying, to wit if I felt its
Force.</p>

<p>"And now my Turn hath come to be
trimmed," quod he, "so thou mayst
thrum the Mandoline."</p>

<p>When I went back, there was a Man
with a Burthen leaving the Shop; and
my Master saith, "Follow this Porter to
Master <i>Askew's</i> in <i>Candlewickstrete</i>, and
bring home my little Daughter, who
hath been spending the Forenoon at
her Godfather's." So I went with the
Porter, and on reaching <i>Candlewickstrete</i>,
which was not full of Tallow-chandlers'
Shops, but of Drapers, he shewed me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
Master <i>Askew's</i> House; and I entered
and found him in Parley with a Man in
a red Coat. Quod he, "Well, I suppose
my Lord must have it, but I like not
the Security;" and handed him over a
heavy Bag that seemed full of Money.
Said the Man in Red, stowing the Bag
under his Coat, "You were best not
offend my Lord, for I warrant the Loss
of his Custom would make you the
worse by a pretty Penny." "Tut!"
cries the other, "we could better afford
to lose the Court than the Court to
lose the City." On which, they parted.
"Who art thou, my Lad?" quod he.
"I'm my Master's new 'Prentice," quod
I, "come to fetch Mistress <i>Anne</i>."
"Ah!" quod he, "then you're from
Master <i>Hewet</i>, though you speak as if
there were but one Master in the World....
<i>Anne!</i> sweet <i>Anne</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
And, at his Call, there runneth in a
fair little Gentlewoman, about six Years
of Age. Sure, never was seen so sweet a
Child! Master <i>Askew</i> caught her up in
his Arms and gave her many Kisses, and
told her she must return with me;
whereon she came and placed her Hand
in mine, in full Assurance of Faith. A
Gentlewoman, not much turned of thirty,
personable, and of the Complexion they
call sanguine, followed her forth, with
many Injunctions to tell her Father how
good she had been, and giving her, at
parting, a Piece of sweet Marchpane.</p>

<p>In the Strete, we were so beshoved
about, that Mistress <i>Anne</i> presently made
Request of me to carry her. So I took
her up and set her on my Shoulder, and
bade her hold on by my Hair; which
she was pleased to say was shorter than
mine Ears, or even than mine Eyelashes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
And, in seeking to admeasure them, she
nearly toppled down; so then I said if
she were going to be unruly, besides
blinding me with the Crumbs of her
Marchpane, I must set her in the Stokkes.
To which she made Answer, "Then you
must put both my Feet into one Hole;
and even then I shall slip them out."
Thus prettily she prattled all the Way,
till I told her I thought my Hair was at
least shorter than her Tongue. When
we reached my Master's Door, I was
passing it unawares, when she lugged at
mine Hair and cried, "Stop, Boy, stop;
you must set me down." I said,
"Then you must give me a Kiss."
She sayth, "Humph, I've no Objection;"
which I thought very funny
and very pretty in so young a little
Gentlewoman.</p>

<p>It was now Supper-time; and, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
Fellow-'prentice being out, Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> shewed me how to lay the
Cloth, set forth the Spoons, &amp;c., and told
me that London 'Prentices stood behind
their Master's Chair at Meal Times. Just
as <i>Tib</i> the Cook had set the Dishes on
the Table, there entereth a hale, aged
Man, white headed, with a merry Eye,
and a thin Cheek besprent with lively
red. My Master hailed him with Zest,
crying, "Ha! Master <i>Cheke</i>! 'tis of long
Time since we met! How fareth it
with thee, Master <i>Cheke</i>? Come in,
Man, come in and sup with us, and,
if thou wilt, lie to-night in the Green
Lattice; there's the old Bed made
up."</p>

<p>"Old Bed!" quod the other, jocularly;
is anything old fit to be offered to me
that am so young and so fine? What
though I'm from the Country, have I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
not Friends at Court? Marry, Man,
my Kinsman is the King's Sub-tutor,
and I've had Speech of him this
Day."</p>

<p>"If you are too fine for old Friends,
I have no more to say to you," quod
Master <i>Hewet</i>, heartily, and taking his
Place at Table, while his Visitor and
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> did the same. "You
can't be <i>our</i> Master <i>Cheke</i>.... Now
then, Sir, boiled or roast? You see,
though 'tis <i>Friday</i>, we are not quite
so scrupulous as we were wont of old
Time, in regard to a broiled Bone or
so ... here's nothing from salt Water
save a Dish of Prawns."</p>

<p>"And very pretty Picking," sayth
Master <i>Cheke</i>, "for a Man that hath had
one Supper already off a King's
Leavings ... for, you see, the pretty Boy goes
to Bed at eight o' the Clock. What a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
young Miracle 'tis! A very Saint, Sir!
excelling any <i>Edward</i> hath been canonized.
Marry, my Kinsman said I should
have seene the sweet Child blush, when
'twas told him he was King; and then
fall a weeping for his Father, whom,
peradventure, none other loved soe
purely; for Love kindles Love, they
say, and, of a Surety, if the old King
loved any one, he loved <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Then, his Grace's Speech on his
Crownation-day," quod Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>.
"They brought him the three
Swords, for the three Kingdoms.
'There ought to be yet another,' quod
he, looking about; 'bring me a Bible.'
When 'twas brought,&mdash;'This,' saith he,
'is the Sword of the Spirit; as the
other three are the Swords of our Temporal
Dominions: by them we govern,
by this we must be governed, and under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
this we ought to live, to fight, to rule,
and to guide all our Affairs.' A marvellous
Saying for a Boy of nine Year
old!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I dare say my Kinsman put him
up to it," said Master <i>Cheke</i>, "but indeed
'twas well rehearsed and well remembered."</p>

<p>"Nay, I like not to hear the Credit
of a good Thing taken away from its
proper Owner in that Way," quod
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> somewhat warmly.
"Why should we say, 'Such an One was
prompted?' 'such a Thing was forecast?'
Doubtless, we all get our
Teaching ... from ourselves or others;
and some few, I think, be Heaven-taught."</p>

<p>"Well, well," quod Master <i>Cheke</i>,
shelling his Prawns; "'twas a pretty
Word, we all must own. How he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
chode with his Nurse, e'en in the Nursery,
for standing on a Bible to reach
Somewhat off a Shelf!"</p>

<p>"And that was before he learned Lip wisdom
of Master <i>Cheke</i>," quod Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i>. "However, Sir, I disparage
not your Kinsman, though I will not
hear you disparage the King. Honour
to whom Honour is due."</p>

<p>I saw an almost imperceptible uprising
of Master <i>Cheke's</i> Eyebrows at this, as
though he were inwardly saying, "Place
to Ladies:" howbeit, Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>
kept her Ground, and, I thought, becomingly.
She thought so too, and mentioned
afterwards that she had given it to
him roundly.</p>

<p>Master <i>Hewet</i> was diverting the Discourse,
when a Cry without of "Clubs!
Clubs!" was followed by a Shrilling
and Screaming like Swifts round a Steeple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
and an uproarious Hallooing and Whooping
all along the Bridge. Master <i>Cheke</i>
started up, and then re-seated himself,
muttering, "Young Rascallions!"</p>

<p>"And yet," quod Master <i>Hewet</i>, "they
are the Stuff our sober substantial Citizens
are made of. Oh, Sir, I don't
mind speaking freely before my 'Prentice
Lads. They will hear no dangerous
Matter from me, and cannot be too
early made to feel that we are all one
Family. Let them be merry and wise;
the Error is in aiming to be one without
the other."</p>

<p>I would I could call to Mind othermuch
that was said: howbeit, I was
young and new to Service, and had not
yet attained unto the Facility which
practised Servitors have of noting each
Thing said, hinted, or so much as looked
at Table, while attending to such Orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
as "The Mustard, <i>Osborne</i>" ... and so
forth.</p>

<p>But, or ever they had well sate down,
Mistress <i>Anne</i> had run in to wish good
Night; and, contriving to tarry, had remained
awhile at Master <i>Hewet's</i> Knee,
noting all was done and said. And when,
referring to some of the King's Council,
Master <i>Cheke</i> said, "They are new to
their Work, but will take kindly to
it presently," she softly sayth, "Like
our new 'Prentice!" which made all
laugh.</p>

<p>When Master <i>Cheke</i> had departed, and
the Day's Work and Prayer were ended,
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> said she would sit up
for <i>Miles Hackathrift</i>, who was out too
late, and bade me go to Bed, for that she
saw I was weary: (and indeed I had
ridden the Pillion twenty Mile that Morning.)
Wherefore I thankfully crept up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
to the Loft a-top of the House, wherein
were two Tressel-beds; and no sooner lay
down than I was asleep; and might have
slept all Night without so much as turning;
but by and by I was arouzed by
the Light of a Lanthorn held close to
mine Eyes, which opened, somewhat
dazed, on a red, swollen Face, that had
too little Brow and too much Cheek and
Chin. Then a surly Voice sayth, "So
thou's the new 'Prentice, it seemeth!
Good so! how prettily thy Mother in
the Country hath had thine Hair cut!"
I said, "It was cut in Town, not in the
Country.&mdash;Go away, and take the Light
out of mine Eyes, I pr'ythee.... I
think thou hast been drinking Something
stronger than small Ale, and hast
broken thine Indenture." ... "Then
I'll brake Something else," quod he;
and gave me a Bang on the Head with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
his Lanthorn, that put the Candle out.
Thereafter he had to go to Bed in the
Dark; but I wot not if he grumbled
thereat, so soon fell I again on Sleep, too
weary to resent his Malefices.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />&nbsp;<i>First Day of a London 'Prentice his Life</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt="T"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Thou</span>
mayest marvel, <i>Hew</i>,
that I remember so well
the minutest Circumstances
of that, my first
Day on the Bridge; but
by Reason of a young, quick Apprehensiveness
of Novelty, I remember that Day
better than any other (but one) in the
Year; and that Year better than many
that came after it.</p>

<p>Early as I rose the next Morning, it
would seem that some one was yet earlier
than I; for my Master's large Bible lay
open on the Table, as though some one
had been a reading it. And, whereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
my good Mother had early taught me,
during the Famine of <span class="smcap">God's</span> Word, to
snatch a Mouthful of it whenever it came
in my Way, albe it were but a single
Sentence to chew the Cud upon pleasantly
at my Work, I cast mine Eye upon the
Page, and lighted by Hap on the Saying,
"Whatsoever thine Hand findeth to do,
<i>do it with thy Might</i>,"&mdash;when my Master's
Hand was laid upon my Shoulder, and
made me start.</p>

<p>"My Lad," quod he, "a Mind sequestering
itself to the Exercises of Piety,
lies very open to the farther Discoveries
of divine Light and Love, and invites
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> to come and dwell in it." I
louted low, to thank him for his Grace,
albeit it seemed to me he took me for a
better and wiser Lad than I was. But
good Praise takes root and spreads; and
there was no great Damage in his giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
me a little more Credit than I deserved;
inasmuch as we are not born good, but
made good.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Master <i>Hewet</i> taketh me to
the very topmost Floor of our House,
next the 'Prentices' Loft, and openeth a
creaking Door; whereon we enter a low,
longish Attick, containing two Looms, at
one of which sate a Man weaving. There
was a Lattice almost the entire Length of
the Attick, looking down upon the bright
shining <i>Thames</i>, then sparkling in the
Morning Sun, and all in a Tremble beneath
a smart Breeze, while heavy Barges
and light Boats full of Garden Stuff for
the Markets were passing to and fro.
The Chamber, though abject to look at,
was delightsome to look from; and the
Air was so clear that I could see a Housewife
in a Stamel Petticoat cheapening
Neats' Feet on the <i>Bankside</i>, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
<i>Easterlings</i> unloading their Cargoes at the
<i>Steelyard</i>. But the Man at the Loom had
no Eye for these Things; he seemed not
much under fifty Years of Age, and had
a pale, pain-worn Face, and patient, gentle,
though not happy Aspect. A Blackbird
in a Wicker Cage hung at the open Window;
there were some two or three old
Books on a Shelf, and a dozen Flowerpots
or so on a little Ledge outside the
Attick, between the Roofs, which was
railed in and made into a Sort of little
Garden.</p>

<p>"Here's a Man, now," quod my Master
to me in a low Voice, "hath so little Care
for aught beyond these four Walls, as
never e'en to have spared Time to look
on <i>Fisher's</i> Head at the Bridge End all
the While the Strete was so thronged
with the gazing Rabble as that scarcely
a Horse nor Cart could pass. Nor do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
I believe he would have cast a Look up
at poor Sir <i>Thomas More</i>, save on his
Way to the Burreller's. A fair Morning,
<i>Tomkins</i>!"</p>

<p>"A fair Morning, as you say, Master,"
returned <i>Tomkins</i>, "I wish you Joy of it."</p>

<p>"Here's your new Scholar," quod my
Master; "you will set him going, and
are scarce likely to find him more awkward
than <i>Miles</i>."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall find him a good Deal
less so, and less froward, too, or I sha'n't
count him good for much," quod <i>Tomkins</i>,
turning about, and looking hard at
me. "I like his Face, Master," quod he.</p>

<p>"Here, give him the Shuttle, and let
us see how he will handle it," quod
Master <i>Hewet</i>.</p>

<p>"Not mine, he may have <i>Miles's</i>,"
interposed <i>Tomkins</i>, rising with some Difficulty
and going to the other Loom; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
I then observed he was very Lame.
"Here, Lad, see, this is the Way," quod
he.</p>

<p>So I tried, awkwardly enough, and
made them both laugh; and laughed too.
But I went to it with a Will, and anon
they said I was mending.</p>

<p>"<i>Miles</i> might have done an Hour's
Work by this Time," observed <i>Tomkins</i>,
"but I've seen nought of him."</p>

<p>"Because Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> hath sent
him to <i>Trolop's</i> Milk-farm for Curds and
Cream," quod my Master; "don't be
hard upon him."</p>

<p>"I wish he may not do what he did,
the last Time I sent him of an Errand,"
quod <i>Tomkins</i> dryly&mdash;"tarry by the Way
to see a Horse-dealer hanged."</p>

<p>"That would have spoiled my Relish
for Curds and Cream," quod Master
<i>Hewet</i>, "I think he must have returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
ere this&mdash;<i>Ned</i> shall bring up your
Breakfast, <i>Tomkins</i>."</p>

<p>As we went down, "Do all thou
canst, <i>Ned</i>," quod my Master, "in the
Way of small Kindnesses, for that poor
Journeyman Freeman.&mdash;A few Years
since, a Horse trod upon his Foot and
lamed him for Life. My Wife, who
was his Foster-sister, and felt a Kindness
for him, had him here to nurse;
and, by the Time he had recovered as
much as he was ever likely to do, he
had become so fond of us and of his
Attick, that, albeit our Ordinances are
somewhat stringent against Master Clothworkers
keeping Weavers at Journeywork
in their own Houses, the Wardens
have overlooked it in his Case, and let
him abide on Sufferance. And though
I don't expect to make my Fortune by
any Weaving I get out of you or <i>Miles</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
and have indeed Plenty of very different
Work for you, yet 'tis well you should
know somewhat of the Practice of your
Craft, and I look to you to attend to it
whenever you would otherwise be in
Idleness."</p>

<p>When we reached the Ground-floor,
there was Mrs. <i>Fraunces</i> buying Roses
and Gilly-flowers at the Door, which she
afterwards set in Midst of the Breakfast-table;
for 'twas a notable Way of hers I
always observed from the first, to contrive
to give e'en the simplest Meal the Air
of a little Banquet, whether by a Posy,
a Dish of Fruit, or whatever it might
chance, to grace her plain, plenteous
Providings.</p>

<p>The first Note I had of <i>Miles Hackathrift</i>
being at Hand, was when I returned
from carrying up to <i>Tomkins</i> his fried Fish
and Bracket. He came behind me, took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
me by the Shoulders, and gave me a smart
shaking.</p>

<p>"Come, now," quod I, when he had
done, "art thou going to be civil or
troublesome?"</p>

<p>"Troublesome," replied he decidedly.</p>

<p>"Oh! well," quod I, "then we shall
not come to a good Understanding, it
seems, till I have given you a Beating;
but for your Sake I'll put it off as long
as I can."</p>

<p>"Your Time is mine, sir," quod he,
"don't be in a Hurry, nor yet put it off
too long. The smallest Favour shall
be cheerfully accepted."</p>

<p>"Ah," quod I, "if that were a true
Word of yours, how pleasantly we might
get on together."</p>

<p>"Pleasantly! quite the other Way, I
think," quod he. "Why, quarrelling's
the very Spice of Life!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
"Keep Spice for rich Men's Tables,
then," quod I, "I can eat my Breakfast
very well without it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" saith he, "you've been brought
up by your Mother!"</p>

<p>"And what if I have?" quod I quickly.</p>

<p>"<i>Have</i> you, though?" quod he, laughing.
"Marry, you have now told Tales
of yourself! Though I could have
guessed it."</p>

<p>"May there never be a worse Tale to
tell of you," quod I. "How mean
you?" quod he, bristling up. "Just
what I say and no more," quod I; "my
meaning is full simple, I think." "Like
yourself, then," quod he; "I don't believe
you could say Bo! to a Goose."
"Nor Pruh! to a Cow, perhaps," quod I.
"Lads! Lads! be quiet there!" cries
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> from the Parlour.</p>

<p>"What would be the Effect of that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
though?" quod <i>Miles</i>, without minding
her, as soon as he had done Coughing by
reason of a Fish-bone that stuck in his
Throat. "To set them scampering,"
quod I, "as I did one Day, into the
midst of a Pleasure Party." "Ha, ha,
ha!" cries he, "I'll try that in <i>Trolop's</i>
Fields; there are Lots of Cows there,
and Pleasure Parties too on Summer
Evenings. Lovers and Loveresses, a
eating of Curds and Whey!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Really, Brother," saith Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i>, the next Time my Master went
into the Parlour,&mdash;for though her Voice
was low and sweet, it was so distinct that
oft-times I could not help hearing what
she was saying,&mdash;"truly, Brother, those
Boys of yours wrangle so when they're
together, that it is Misery to hear
them."</p>

<p>"Boys will be Boys," quod he, peaceifyingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
"I was one myself a long while
ago. However, if they have said anything
punishable, I must beat them;
but, if not, put a little Cotton Wool
into your Ears, Sister <i>Fraunces</i>."</p>

<p>"Nay," quod she, relenting, "there
was nothing punishable in aught they
said; and, as to getting them a Beating,
they'll give each other enough of that,
I'm thinking. 'Twas such give and
take, snip and snap, parry and thrust,
as that I could scarce forbear laughing."</p>

<p>"Don't stop your Ears with Cotton
Wool, then," quod my Master cheerily,
for a hearty Laugh is worth a Groat.
"They'll have little Time for Fighting,
this Morning, for I have Plenty for
them to do."</p>

<p>Despite of this, however, <i>Miles</i> found
Time for a little more "snip and snap,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
as Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> called it, before
Dinner. Seeing me start forth on an
Errand as he returned from one, he
quietly saith in passing, "See how pretty
he looks with his Cap on!" whereon
it struck me that every 'Prentice Boy I
had seen running about had gone bareheaded;
and, smiling, I put my Cap in
my Pocket.</p>

<p>In those Times, <i>Hew</i>, the Saturday
Afternoon was somewhat between a Holiday
and a holy Day. People went to
Evening Service at three o'Clock, and,
after that, there was no Business done,
save in preparation for the Sabbath; and
thoughtful People enjoyed an holy Pause,
and young light Hearts took their Pastime.</p>

<p><i>Miles</i>, with Mischief in his Eye, proposed
to me a Row on the River, which
I, nothing afeard, agreed to, for I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
been in a Punt aforetime, if not in a
Wherry. He refused the Aid of a Waterman,
saying lightly, "This young Gentleman
knows the Use of a Scull;" and,
running hastily along the Boat to secure
the Stroke-oar, his Foot tripped against a
Thwart, and he lost his Balance and fell
into the River. I guessed where he would
come up, and, sitting on the further Gunnel
to trim the Boat, held the Oar to him,
and guided his Hand to the Side, which
enabled him to scramble in. The Watermen,
who had run down to us as soon as
they saw him fall over, laughed when
they saw him safe, and cheered me; and
he, looking rather foolish, sayth, "Well,
I told them thou knewest the Use of a
Scull." I asked him which Way we
should pull; howbeit, he was so drenched
that he must needs go Home to change
his Clothes, and bade me give the Waterman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
a Penny, saying he had not so much
as a <i>Genoa</i> Halfpenny about him just then
to buy a Custard at Mother <i>Mampudding's</i>.
When he had changed his Under-garments,
and hung his Gown at the Kitchen
Fire, he amused himself by dropping
Pellets from the Window on the People
in the Boats that shot the Arch beneath;
and <i>Tib</i>, with her Head stretched forth of
the other Half of the Lattice, offered to
Rehearse unto me the Name and Calling
of every Dweller on the Bridge, from the
Parson and Clerk at the one End, to the
old Lady that lived all alone by herself
with her Cats at the other. Howbeit,
<i>Miles</i>, tiring of waiting for his Gown to
dry, put on another, and bade me bear
him Company to <i>Finsbury Fields</i>. But
first he lay in Wait behind the Door, and
then stole subtilly forth, like a Cat that
had been stealing Cream; and on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
asking him why, he laughed and said,
only that Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> might not see
him in his Sunday-gown of a Saturday,
for that would be contrary to Rules and
Regulations.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Arrived at <i>Finsbury Fields</i> I saw what
was certainly the finest and busiest Sight
I had ever yet seen in my Life; which
indeed is not saying much. The Fields
themselves were open and pleasant, with
plenty of Windmills in full Rotation in
the Distance; their white Sails playing
afore a dark Rain-cloud; and the Stretes
that led to them beyond <i>Moor Gate</i>, full
of Shops kept by Bowyers, Fletchers, and
Stringers. Here, on the open Ground,
we found, I say not Crowds, but Shoals
of lithe and limber 'Prentices; and of
athletic Freemen, too, and grave and
weighty Citizens, where was Room for
all&mdash;with Archers' Butts set up in various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
Directions; and an infinite Number of
the finest young Men the City could turn
out, practising at them with their long
Bows; none of them being allowed to
shoot at a Mark nearer than eleven score
Yards. Numbers of the Masters, standing
by, were watching, encouraging, and
applauding them, to their great Increase
of Emulation. Others again were using
their Wasters and Bucklers, others kicking
the Football; in the more open
Ground, Citizens' Sons were racing on
Horseback, and some of them practising
Feats of War; others were wrestling,
leaping, and casting the Stone. And on
every Hand, Venders of Cakes and Suckets.
On the Field, we came unawares upon
Master <i>Hewet</i>, who spake us kindly, and
noted not the Matter of <i>Miles'</i> Sunday-gown.
And so the Day ended.</p>

<p>As we went Home, <i>Miles</i> told me how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs were
accustomed on St. <i>Bartholomew's</i> Day to
see the City Officers wrestle with all
Comers, at a set Place in <i>Clerkenwell</i>;
and, two or three Days after, to witness
the shooting of the broad Arrow, both of
which I thought I should much delight
to behold; but was quite unfit for when
the Time came; as thou, in due Course,
shalt know.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />&nbsp;<i>Ye Disposition &amp; Economy of Master
Hewet's House</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="100" height="103" alt="M"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">My</span>
Master's House had six
Stories, the lowest of which
was sixty Feet above the
River. First came the Kitchen,
which, being partly
sunk in the Arch, might, if not in a
Bridge, have been counted parcel-underground.
It had a Casement just over the
Key-stone, and no thorough Draught;
the Larder being a Lean-to or Afterthought,
stuck outside like a Bird's Nest
against the Wall. Level with the Strete
lay the Shop, with a small Ware-room or
Writing-closet adjoining; and, behind it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
three Steps above it by Reason of the
Kitchen beneath, the common Sitting-room,
overlooking the River. A narrow,
steep Stair led to the Floor above, which
had Mistress <i>Fraunces's</i> Sleeping-chamber,
wherein lay Mistress <i>Anne</i>, over the Shop,
and a Summer-parlour, which for that it
had a Balcony over the River, commonly
went by the Name of the Balcony Room.
It was hung with blue Buckram; and,
by Reason of its Pleasantness, Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> made it her chief Sitting-room,
while Mistress <i>Anne</i> played with her
Dolls. Also there was a Closet wherein
lay <i>Tib</i>. Above this was a large Chamber
that covered the whole Floor from Front
to Back, with a Window at either End;
and, because of its projecting and overlapping
the Floor below, was sundry Feet
the longer: this Room was wonderful
pleasant, and commonly called the Green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
Lattice, or Lattice-room, from having a
large green Lattice that overlooked the
<i>Thames</i>. In my Master's early married
Days, which he was wont to say had
been, like those of many a young Husband,
his poorest and happiest, he had
been glad to let off this Chamber to a
Lodger.&mdash;His Father dying, and leaving
him Money, he left the retail for wholesale
Business, gave up his Lodger, and
used the best Chamber himself; but with
Wealth came, as usual, a Counterpoise:
his Wife died untimely in this same
Chamber; whereon he conceived a Dislike
of it; and Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> then
coming to reside with him and occupying
his old Quarters, he mounted up to the
fourth Story, to a Room that o'erlooked
the Strete. Above this was <i>Tomkins</i>'
Attick, and, last of all, our Loft. The
Wind whistled fearsomely up there, o'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
Nights, and made the Walls rock round
us; not that there was often any one
wakeful enough to mind it.</p>

<p>In the Green Lattice, though unoccupied,
there stood a carven Oak Bed, with
dark green Hangings, lined with yellow
Fustian, and Linen a Miracle for Whiteness,
ready for any chance Guest. I
thought, boy-like, as I glanced in, passing
up and down, 'twas fit for the Sleeping
Beauty to lie in during her Trance of a
hundred Years. There was a great Jar
of dead Rose-leaves, that smelt rarely;
and I always had the Notion they had
been gathered by Mistress <i>Anne's</i> Mother.
I wondered, with a strange yet pleasing
Awe, whether her Ghost ever
walked here, now that her little Girl
passed Hours in the Room by herself,
singing over her Dolls; and
thought it might perhaps steal softly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
in and keep about her when we little
wisted.</p>

<p><i>Tib</i>, the Cook, made and kept but few
Friends. She was turned of Forty, and
had a notable scorched Face, that looked
like a Kitchen Fire. Also she was a
Woman of much Thirst, both for Ale
and News; and would have been counted
a notable cleanly Woman, had she not
been so dirty. For Example, she would
set the House afloat with Bucketfuls of
cold Water, till only <i>Noah's</i> Dove could
have found Rest for the Sole of its Foot;
and yet, the next Minute, would fling a
Tub-full of Dish-water straight into the
River, on the Heads of any Passengers
that might hap to be shooting the Arch.
She got into Trouble, once or twice, for
this.</p>

<p>Now, when I fell into my daily Course,
Part of my Time was spent under the Eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
of my Master, and within hearing of his
pleasant Talk, Part in running about the
Town, and Part with <i>Tomkins</i>; so that I
was happy from Morning to Night. For,
<i>Miles</i> not being fond of waiting upon the
poor lame Journeyman, I made it a Labour
of Love; and he, being a tender-spirited
Man, very sensitive to small Kindnesses,
took hugely to me, as I shortly did to
him. He had a busy Mind that was
always at Work, and his Occupation
leaving him much Leisure for Headwork,
he was always chewing the Cud
upon this or that Problem he had conned
at odd Minutes out of his old Books, or
brooding upon Mysteries that were harder
to crack, and less safe for an unlearned
Man to meddle with. Also he had a
mechanical Turn, which he exercised at
what he called his Play Hours, thereby
only exchanging one hard Work for another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
but he was so fond of it that I
was always glad to see his little File and
Pincers in his Hand. Thus it came to
pass, that he never cared to stir from his
Attick into the World beneath, (though
I found, afterwards, he generally contrived
to creep out somewhere on Sundays when
we were all in Church,) for, he said, Air
he had plenty of, Exercise was a Misery
to him, and as for Company, had he not
all he cared for, already? A few kind
Words from Master <i>Hewet</i>, continual Chat
with me, a bright Glimpse of Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, and a Visit now and then from
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>, were all he had and all
he liked. For Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> he had
a wonderful Respect and even Admiration;
commending her gentle Temper,
womanly Carriage, and pleasant Voice;
and bidding me note, (which I did on
his naming,) that she had, for her Years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
the finest Hand that a Woman was ever
graced with. I said I wondered she had
never married. He said, "Aye, indeed,
what can the Men have been about?"
with a little Smile that I did not feel to
be quite respectful; and I wondered that
even the gentle <i>Tomkins</i> must have his
Fling at single Women.</p>

<p>Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> was used to accompany
my Master to the Hall Dinners;
indeed, being a Sister of the Company,
she was liable to a Fine if she did not,
except by Reason of Illness. However,
now and then, she stayed away; and then,
when my Master returned, she would ask
him with great Interest what had been
served up; and, being a shrewd Marketer,
would price each Item as he went along:
thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Brother, and what did you
have to-day?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
"Why," saith he, "there was a Porpoise,
to begin with."</p>

<p>"A Porpoise!" then cries she, "oh!
what a nasty coarse Fish! They are
seldom or never now seen at Table.
Well, what else?"</p>

<p>"Two Congers and two Turbot."</p>

<p>"Ah! of course, Nobody would touch
the Porpoise. Congers, the largest in
<i>Wetfishmongersrow</i>, six Shillings each,
this Morning. Turbots, three&mdash;eighteen.
Well?"</p>

<p>"Sirloin of Beef&mdash;Half a Veal&mdash;a
standing Coney with a blue Ribbon
round his Neck."</p>

<p>"Hold, Brother, not so fast. Beef,
we all know, is a Penny a Pound&mdash;we
thank King <i>Harry</i> for that. I
saw Half a Veal to-day at Half-a-crown."</p>

<p>"Two dozens Pigeons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
"Two Shillings."</p>

<p>"Some of your <i>French</i> Kickshaws&mdash;'<i>Pettiz
Birds rostez</i>.' ... And '<i>pain-puffe
avec un cold bakemeat</i>.'"</p>

<p>"We have that every Sabbath," quod
she, dryly, "without its fine Name. I
suppose you had Sweets."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; <i>Leche Lombard</i>; Pears <i>en
serop</i>; Fritters, Doucettes, and <i>une grande
Custard</i>."</p>

<p>"Come," saith she, "that was pretty
well&mdash;enough, and no Profusion. But
the Porpoise spoiled all. And they
might have given you a Swan instead
of a Coney. But stay; had you no
<i>Mortreuse</i>?"</p>

<p>"No <i>Mortreuse</i>."</p>

<p>"Out on it!" quod she, "then I
would not have given a Fig for your
Feast. There's nothing you had, that
we can't have at Home, save Mortreuse:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
I shall not rest till I know how to
make it."</p>

<p>At this Time, every one in their House
seemed, according to their several Dispositions,
peaceful and happy; e'en <i>Tib</i>, after
her Manner, whether eating a plentiful
Meal, setting the House afloat, stretching
forth of the Kitchen Window in the full
Tide of Gossip with the Maid next Door,
or hemming a Lockram Pinner. She
and <i>Miles</i> were Friends to-day, Foes to-morrow.
One Minute, she would be
giving him a Sop-in-the-pan; the next,
basting him with the Ladle. One Day,
because he had soiled her fresh-scoured
Floor with his muddy Shoes, she protested
he should clean it; they had a
real, earnest Fight, which a Man should
be above having with a Woman;&mdash;and
he pulled out a Lock of her red Hair, a
small one,&mdash;which she snatched up from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
the Floor and pocketed, saying she would
shew it to Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>. Howbeit,
she did not.</p>

<p>I affected a quieter Companion in the
Attick; and one not without his Teaching,
for he was letterish after his Fashion,
and had been in <i>Paul's</i> School. And,
among his much used Books, there was
<i>Lilly's</i> Grammar, and even <i>Prudentius</i> and
<i>Lactantius</i>; and another, in his Eyes
worth all the Rest, calling it "real
Literature," and the others "mere Blotterature,"
a Joke of old Dean <i>Colet's</i>.
This precious Volume looked to me
mighty dull, being full of algebraic
Signs; but he earned many a Headache
over it, and gave me a Headache too,
sometimes, in trying to help him.</p>

<p>Pleasant Hours those were! in that
quiet Attick, with the <i>Thames</i> trembling
in silver Light far below, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
Watermen clave it with their Oars to
the mellow Song of "Heave ho, rumbelow!"
and "Row the Boat, <i>Norman</i>!"
The Blackbird sang as cheerily
as if he were in the green Woods of
<i>Kent</i>; and ever and anon the pretty
Laugh of Mistress <i>Anne</i> would be heard
from the Green Lattice, or she would peep
in and say, "Have a Cake, <i>Edward</i>?"
"Have a Cherry?" and leave her little
Gift and run away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />&nbsp;<i>Noteworthy Deed of a Boy taught of a Woman</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I am</span>
now coming, <i>Hew</i>, to
what hindered me of seeing
the Shew in <i>Clerkenwell</i>
on St. <i>Bartholomew's</i>
Day. Man proposes, but
<span class="smcap">God</span> disposes: all Things are overruled
for Good to them that love him&mdash;I'm
sure I found it so in this Case.</p>

<p>The Weather was now excessive hot:
<i>Miles</i> and I used to take Boat whenever
we had a spare Evening, and practice
Swimming off <i>Battersea</i>. Also, we sometimes
bathed in <i>Perilous Pond</i>, wherein
many 'Prentices are yearly drowned;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
hard by the Well of Dame <i>Annis</i> the
Clear.</p>

<p>As for <i>Tomkins</i>, his whole Soul was in
the making of the queerest Watch that
ever was seen; howbeit, clumsy as it was,
he at last made it go; though it never
could keep up with St. <i>Magnus</i>' Clock.</p>

<p>Master <i>Hewet</i> was anxious, one Forenoon,
to communicate by Letter with an
Agent on the Point of embarquing for
<i>Callice</i>. I had a Race against Time to
the Quay, sped my Errand, and returned
beneath a broiling Noon-day Sun. When
I got back, I was overheated and very
thirsty, and thought I would step into
the Kitchen for a Drink of cold Water.
I had pulled off my warm blue Gown to
cool myself, and went into the Kitchen
with it hanging on my Arm. Leaning
forth of the Lattice, according unto her
Wont, was <i>Tib</i>, a parleying with the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Door Servant; and with her left Arm
cast about the Waist of Mistress <i>Anne</i>,
who sate on the Window-sill with her
Back to the River. On seeing me come
in, the little Maiden clapped her Hands,
which startling <i>Tib</i>, who supposed herself
caught by Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>, she maketh
no more Ado, but turns short round in a
Flurry, giving a Lurch with her left Arm
that cast the pretty Innocent headlong
into the River. I remember <i>Tib</i> squealed;
but without a second Thought, I dropped
my Gown that so luckily was off, and
took a Leap that was clean sixty Feet
into the River, without so much as a
Thought what I should do when I got
there. I remember the Blow the Water
gave my Head, and what a Way I went
down, and how I bobbed up again, as
Providence would have it, with the dear
little Fondling within Arm's-length of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
me, drifting towards the Fall beyond the
Arch. I clutched at her by the pretty
Waist, just as the Eddy was going to suck
her in, and, striking out once or twice
with the other Arm, though the Rapids
were bearing me down horribly, found
myself the next Minute a clinging on to
the Sterling, without Power to climb up
it, so spent was I, and feeling as if I must
lose Hold of little <i>Anne</i> after all! I wot
not how much of the Noise I then seemed
to hear was the Water singing in mine
Ears, and the Uproar of the Falls; howbeit,
there were People hallooing above
and around, and my Master's Voice a-top
of all, from the Parlour Window, overhead,
crying, "Hold on, <i>Ned</i>, for thy
Life! we'll save you, my brave Boy!
Cling to him, <i>Anne</i>, if he can't cling to
thee!"</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/075-img.jpg" width="400" height="585" alt="Leap"/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="cursive">"And took a leap"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And, before this, there had been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
Roar, as if through a Speaking-trumpet,
of "Boat a-hoy!" and I heard Oars
plashing fast, though I could not spare
Strength to turn my Head to see how
near Help was. Then a rough, kindly
Hand laid hold of me from behind; and,
finding I had no Power to help myself,
the Waterman took me under the Arms,
and lifted me clean into the Boat, with
the dear little Girl hanging about my
Neck. Oh! what a Cheer there was!
I heard it then, <i>I hear it now</i>: it came
from around and from above, as if <span class="smcap">God's</span>
Angels were hovering over us. We were
rowed swiftly to the Landing, where
there was a Press of People that mutely
fell back to make Way for Master <i>Hewet</i>,
as he ran down the Stairs. For he was
greatly loved along the Bridge. He
would have caught little <i>Anne</i> from me;
but I could neither speak nor let her go;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
and he sayth, "So best!" and burst forth
into Tears. That sett off all the rest;
and when some one afterwards said,
"Wherefore cheered ye him not when
he came a-land?" another made
Answer, "How could we? all were in
Tears." So I went along, carrying
little <i>Anne</i>, still fast to my Neck, with
her Cheek close pressed to mine, and
they said, "It's all right, it's his
Triumph." But I thought not so
much of any Triumph, just then, as how
thankful I was to <span class="smcap">God</span>. When we got
to the House, Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> took the
poor, drenched Innocent from mine Arms;
and Master <i>Hewet</i>, taking me round the
Neck, absolutely kissed me. Which was
a memorable Thing for a Master to do
by his 'Prentice. Only, you see, I had
saved his Daughter.</p>

<p>Well, that Evening was spent betwixt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
laughing and crying&mdash;scolding <i>Tib</i>, and
<i>Tib's</i> saying she must leave, and Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> saying no one would take her
with such a Character as she must give
her; and then my Master interfering and
saying she must go for a While at least,
to her Friends, till he could endure the
Sight of her, and then <i>Tib</i> crying and
saying she had got no Friends, and his
relenting and saying, Well, then she must
stay till she could get another Place, and
keep out of his Sight all she could, and
never do so any more. Then came
Supper, I waiting on my Master, and
Mistress <i>Anne</i> nestled in his Arms in a
warm Wrapper, for she said if she went
to Bed she should dream of falling into
the Water. And my Master liked to
feel he had her safe, and she and I exchanged
many fond Looks; and we grew
merry. For Master <i>Hewet</i> filled me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
Cup from a long, narrow-necked Bottle
of some marvellous pleasant Wine, and
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> helped us all round to
a Cake that had ne'er its like for Richness;
and there were People dropping in
to inquire, and bewail, and felicitate. So
the Bottle was soon emptied; and when
I went to Bed, my Head was in a Maze,
and my Temples beating like Blacksmiths'
Hammers. As for Sleep!&mdash;whenever it
came nigh me, bang went mine Head
against the Water!&mdash;and I rose up with
a great Start. While, as long as I lay
awake, I heard (and saw too, with mine
Eyes ever so close shut), People cheering
and crying and casting Ropes, and leaning
out of Lattices, and rowing Boats that
made no Way; and felt <i>Anne's</i> Arm slipping
from my Neck, and I with no
Strength to hold her; and, through and
above all, the great Bell of St. <i>Magnus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
clanging and tolling, through the livelong
Night.</p>

<p>But, what was very marvellous, when
Morning came at last, and, I suppose, I
awoke, though it seemed me I had never
fallen on Sleep, ... there was I, not
in the Loft, but in the Green Lattice
Chamber, lying on that beautiful Bed I
thought fit for the Sleeping Beauty!
And there was a Chirurgeon with a
Lancet in his Hand, and there were
Basins and Bandages, and my left Arm
was stiffened, and I felt very weak. Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> had her Arm aneath mine
Head, and my Master, with his grave,
kind Face, stood a-foot of the Bed. And,
to my great Surprise, I heard <i>Twelve o'
the Clock</i> striking on the Bell of St.
<i>Magnus</i>, and, I think, every other Clock
in <i>London</i>, my Hearing seemed so tender;
and the Phlebotomist sayth, "He'll do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
now.&mdash;Next Time you leap from such
a height, my Boy, clasp thine Hands
a-top of thine Head. Howbeit, you
will now soon get well."</p>

<p>&mdash;But oh! I did not soon get well.
For I wot not what had come over
me, ... none of us ever could rightly
tell, ... whether the sudden Chill after
being so hot, or the Plunge from so great
an Height, or the Turn of my Blood
with Fright at seeing <i>Anne</i> fall in, ...
but as soon as ever I essayed to arise and
dress, my Master and <i>Tomkins</i> being by,
I began tumbling about and could neither
hear nor see; leastwise Nothing that was
really to be seen and heard. And with
such fearsome Pains in my Head! So
hot, and yet so cold! Such Thirst, and
such loathing of Food!</p>

<p>In short, I was sick nigh to Death
of what the Leeches call Brain Fever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
Thereon the Kindness I received is past
all telling. Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> seemed
never out of Sight. Also <i>Tib</i> was very
handy and officious, never minding climbing
ever so many Stairs. And <i>Miles</i> did
the odd Work for all, spake under his
Voice, and went about without his Shoes.
At dead o' Night, I sometimes saw my
Master at the Bed-foot, reading his
<i>Tyndal's</i> Testament, (one o' the few that
scaped burning,) with the Lamp shaded
so as not to shine into mine Eyes. At
other Times, <i>Tomkins</i>. But his Book was
never the Testament.</p>

<p>One Night, when the latter was with
me alone, I said suddenly, "<i>Tomkins</i>! the
Night is far spent, the Day is at Hand!"
... "No, Lad," quod he, "it wants
many Hours yet to Day. It hath but
just struck eleven." "Ah, but," quod
I, "those Words I used are Scripture, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
think, for I heard Master <i>Hewet</i>, as he
sate a-reading, whisper them over to
himself. Do look out for them, will
you, that I may know I was not dreaming.
They worry me."</p>

<p><i>Tomkins</i> did not much like the Talk;
howbeit, he laid down his own Book, and
turned over the other.</p>

<p>"I don't see them," quod he.</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> you, in the Dark?" quod I.</p>

<p>"I'm not in the Dark!" quod he.</p>

<p>"Well then," quod I, turning on my
Pillow restlessly, "I suppose <i>I</i> am. I
thought you had been, but peradventure
I'm wandering again."</p>

<p>After long Silence, he sayth, in a Voice
hushed, and quite altered, "I have them
now ... they are close to your Master's
Mark." And continued reading.</p>

<p>After a While, I saw him turn back
again to his Starting-point, and sit in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
Muze, with his Eyes fixed; and after that,
read again.</p>

<p>I said softly to him, presently, "<i>Tomkins</i>,
where do you go on Sundays?"</p>

<p>"Who spoke?" cried he with a Start.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> did," quod I. "Who else <i>should</i>
speak?"</p>

<p>"Thy Voice sounded so low and sweet,
Boy," quod he, recovering himself,
"that I wist not it was thine."</p>

<p>"Well, but," persisted I, "where <i>do</i>
you go on Sundays?"</p>

<p>"Not to Church," answered he, after a
Pause.</p>

<p>"But why not, <i>Tomkins</i>? Hast thou
not a Soul to be saved, as much as
we?"</p>

<p>"As much, no more," returned he, "if
we <i>have</i> any Souls."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried I, half starting up, but
obliged to fall back again directly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
"could a Man without a Soul <i>make a
Watch</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well," quod he, after a Pause, "there
you pose me. But all, all is dark."</p>

<p>"<i>Tomkins!</i>" cried I, "you make my
Head ache ready to split, and my Eyeballs
seem too big for mine Eye-lids to
shut over them. So hot, too, as they
are! I cannot argue with you. But,
oh, <i>Tomkins</i>! if all is dark, remember
that 'the Night is far spent, the Day is
at Hand!'"</p>

<p>"So this Book sayeth," rejoined he,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, sighing, "I shall soon
know."</p>

<p>"<i>Know?</i> why?"</p>

<p>"Why, because, <i>Tomkins</i>, I think I am
very likely dying ... and then, if I
have no Soul, where do you think I
shall go to?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
"I think," quod he, drawing his
Hand across his Eyes, "that <i>you</i> will
go to Heaven ... if there be such a
Place."</p>

<p>"I think so too, and feel sure of it,"
said I.</p>

<p>"What makes you feel sure?" quod he.</p>

<p>"Well," quod I, "I seem to have a
sort of Witness in myself."</p>

<p>"I wish I had," quod he, sighing
deeply: and returned to his Reading.</p>

<p>"What have you come to, now?" quod
I presently, seeing him stop.</p>

<p>"<i>Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</i>,"
quod <i>Tomkins</i>.</p>

<p>"Such? what?"</p>

<p>"Little Children, like Mistress <i>Anne</i>
... and Lads like you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said I, "if I had not got her
out of the Water, she'd have been in
Heaven now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
"I suppose you don't want her to <i>be</i>
there, though?" said <i>Tomkins</i>. "Time
enough for that&mdash;she'll go there when
her Hour comes."</p>

<p>"Oh! then you think there <i>is</i> such a
Place to go to, do you?"</p>

<p>"For you and for her," quod he,
cautiously.</p>

<p>"You say that to humour me, I fear,
<i>Tomkins</i>, because I am ill. If there
be such a Place for us, why not for
you?"</p>

<p>"Lad, you must keep quiet, and not
talk so, or you'll go there sooner than
I wish."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad thou admittest there
is such a Place," returned I, beginning
to feel greatly spent. "Only I wish you
felt you should go there too."</p>

<p>"Boy, I'm not good enough," ejaculated
he, with a shake of the Head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
"Ah, if you feel that, I don't despair
of you," quod I. "There's Hope for
those that feel like forgiven Sinners or
unforgiven Sinners: the only hopeless
ones are those that don't feel Sinners at
all. And now, <i>Tomkins</i>, just give me
Something to drink."</p>

<p>He did so, holding up my Head on his
Arm. "Is there Anything else," quod
he, "I can do for thee?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," quod I, wistfully, "and
then I think I could go to sleep."</p>

<p>"What is it?" saith he very kindly.
"I'll do it for thee."</p>

<p>&mdash;"<i>Tomkins</i>, is it St. <i>Bartholomew's</i> Eve
yet? my Head is confused."</p>

<p>"<i>Bartholomew's</i> Eve, Lad? Why,
that's passed!"</p>

<p>"Oh me! ... how long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not many Days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Days?" And I felt so lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
&mdash;"Then, the Swifts are gone!"
said I.</p>

<p>"Well, don't let's think about the
Swifts," quod he gently. "<i>Tempus fugit</i>,
as the Dial-plate says. What is it thou
wilt have me to do?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tomkins!</i>"&mdash;and I reached his Ear
down to me as he leant over me, "I've
been so weak and so queer ever since I
fell into the Water, that I don't believe,
at least I can't remember having once
said my Prayers ... will you say one
for me?"</p>

<p>"I can't, Boy," and a hot Tear fell on
my Face.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can! ... and then I
should sleep quietly&mdash;Ever so short an
one!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't remember <i>one</i>" said he, turning
away his Head.</p>

<p>"Not one? Oh, <i>Tomkins</i>, indeed, indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
you must! For <i>my</i> Sake&mdash;Just
this short one ... '<span class="smcap">God</span> be merciful
to me, a Sinner!'"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">God</span> be merciful to me, a Sinner,"
repeated he, bursting forth into Weeping;
and I drew his Face down yet closer unto
mine. "Thank you, <i>Tomkins</i>" quod I;
"now I shall sleep soundly." And I
slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />&nbsp;<i>Edward convalesceth i' the Green Lattice</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="100" height="101" alt="W"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">When</span>
mine Eyes opened
next Morning, my loved
<i>Mother's</i> dear, pale Face
was hanging over me.
"Child," quod she, "Misfortunes
never come alone&mdash;When
Master <i>Hewet's</i> Post came to <i>Ashford</i>
with News of thy Sickness, I was far
from Home, in <i>Westmoreland</i>, at the
Death-bed of thine Uncle <i>Lancelyn</i>;
and I wist not till Yesterday, what
News was awaiting my Return." ...
And she hung over me, and bathed my
Face in her Tears. "But I am proud of
thee, my <i>Ned</i>" quod she, "and so would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
thy Father have been. And thou hast
taken off from thee the Reproach of
being taught of a Woman as well as born
of a Woman ... my dear, dear Son!"</p>

<p>Oh! what a Heaven it was to get well!
There was my loved <i>Mother</i> beside me at
her Sewing, telling me of <i>Ashford</i> and the
green Lanes of <i>Kent</i>, and of the wild Hills
of <i>Westmoreland</i>, till I seemed to be there
myself. There was Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>
cockering me up, first with Sweets and
cooling Drinks, and then with savoury
and strengthening Things; even to <i>Mortreuse</i>
and <i>Leche Lombard</i>! And when I
was able to sit up at the green Lattice,
Mistress <i>Anne</i> and I would look down on
the Barges and Boats, and play at divers
Games and tell divers Stories. The
Lodger that had beforetime occupied this
Chamber, had left a Heap of old Books
and written Papers, which, having Nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
private in them, my Master said I was
free to look over. There was Part of a
Chronicle of <i>English</i> History, whether the
Writer's own Composure or a Traduction,
I wot not; but brave and pleasant Reading,
about the Courts of <i>England</i>, <i>France</i>,
<i>Spain</i>, and <i>Flanders</i>, in the Time of our
<i>Edward</i> the <i>Third</i>, and Queen <i>Philippa</i>.
Another Work was a Romaunt of Love
and Chivalry: also an Account of <i>London
Bridge</i>, and <i>Chaucer's Canterbury Tales</i>,
and a Treatyse on Fysshynge. Likewise,
there was a great Roll of Drawings, done,
I afterwards found, by another Lodger,
in black and red Chalk, much fouled,
smeared, and chafed, but diverting to look
at, being Representations of Men, Women,
Children, Skeletons, Death's Heads, Bones,
Angels, Fiends, Hippogriffs,&mdash;and divers
other Presentments; with <i>H. H.</i> writ at
the End.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Thus pleasantly passed the Time till
the Doctor said I had only now to pick
up my Strength; and my <i>Mother</i> then
thought it Time for her to return to my
little Brothers. The Evening before she
left, she sayth unto me somewhat apologetically,
"<i>Ned</i>, thine Uncle <i>Edward</i>
having died childless, and left all to
thine unmarried Uncle <i>Lancelyn</i>, who
hath now left me his Heir, I am now
well to do, with an hundred Pound
by the Year, real Estate, and, personal
Estate, five hundred Pounds, which I
have taken kind Master <i>Hewet's</i> Advice
concerning the Disposal of. And he,
being kindly affectioned unto thee just
now, (as well he may be,) is pleased
to say thou art sure to make thine
own Way in the World, and to
advise my devising all my personal
Estate unto thy younger Brothers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
thou being secure of the other at my
Death."</p>

<p>Quod I, "Dear <i>Mother</i>, mayst thou
live as long as I shall! There is
Nothing thou canst do so much to my
Mind as to care for <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Julian</i>,
the one of whom is weakly and unfit
for active Life, and the other, I think,
will love Farming. Master <i>Hewet</i>, I
am certified, hath spoken wisely." And
in sooth, I was glad to note what a good
Understanding seemed to exist, on so
short Acquaintance, between him and my
dear <i>Mother</i>.</p>

<p>So, when she was gone, I had Nothing
to do but to get well. Marry! what a
hard Matter, though, it was!&mdash;At first I
was glad to think I might go forth abroad,
and resume my old Gossips with <i>Tomkins</i>.
But the very first Time I essayed to
clamber up to his Attick, though 'twas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
only two short Flights, I found myself so
weak that I was fain to sit down on the
Stair and shed Tears, whether I would or
no. And there, to my very great Shame,
I was found of my Master. He bespake
me kindly, and helped me up, and said
this Weakness would soon go off: howbeit,
it did not.&mdash;I always think that
Chirurgeon bled me too freely: I noted
his saying, "We'll knock him down
first, and then build him up again!"
which carryeth a Sound of Smartness, but
not always answereth with the Event.
Thus, 'twas now found I must still go
softly; and the Weather being sultry,
Master <i>Hewet</i> bade me keep as much as
I could i' the open Air and Shade, and
creep out, as my Strength permitted, to
the Fields, with Mistress <i>Anne</i> to my
Mate. So we went forth Hand in Hand,
for I was past carrying her; and presently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
I say, "Oh me, Mistress! ... I must
sit down"&mdash;and sayth she, "There's a
Door-step i' the Shade a little farther
on, with a nice old Woman on it, selling
Mulberries." So we creep on, and
the little Maid buyeth me Mulberries,
and I eat and rest, and am refreshed.
Then quod I, "Let's go back now, Mistress;"
but sayth she, "Oh, let's try to
go on to <i>Trolop's</i> Milk-farm." So I
love not to cross the little Fondling, and
as soon as we reach the green Meadows,
the fresh, sweet Air seems to take away
that queer, light, fluttering Feel in my
Head, and to refresh and brace me; and
I lie on the Grass i' the Shade, and she
runs hither and thither and gathers Borage,
and Blue Bugloss, and Bushy Red-mint,
and bringeth them to me, saying, "What's
this?" and "What's this?" And so we
go on Day by Day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
Now as touching <i>Miles Hackathrift</i>.
When I first lay sick, I have said he was
mighty softened, and went gently and
seemed amain concerned for me. Howbeit,
Boy's Grief not long lasteth, and he
soon fell tired of feeling or feigning any;
more by Token, he perceived his was
outrun by that of Everyone in the House.
Whereupon he turned about, and grew
indifferent, then jealous, then surly, then
envious, doubtless by small Degrees; but
of this, I, being apart from him, was not
cognizant; and the Change made itself
apparent to me all at once. First, when
Master <i>Hewet</i> was out, he took Advantage
of it to come trampling up Stairs with all
the Clamour he could, singing, "Row the
Boat, Norman!" in a defiant sort of Way;
and when Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> put her Head
forth of the Lattice Chamber and sayth,
"Make not such a Turmoil, <i>Miles</i>," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
pretended to stumble on <i>Tomkins's</i> Stair,
and let a heavy Weight roll all the way
down it. When he clattered down after
it, Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>, watching her Opportunity,
gave him a Rap on the Head, which
I know that white Hand of hers could
not have dealt very heavily; natheless he
took Occasion by it to cry out sharply,
and then give one or two dismal Grones,
which he was too spirited to have done
had he in verity been mal-entreated.
However, finding he might not sing nor
slam Doors while I lay under the Leech's
Care, he turned sulky and held close, so
as that scarce yea or nay was to be had
out of him. When at length I returned
to our Loft, he took Care to do me to wit
how pleasant it had been to him to have
it all to himself; and immediately took
Advantage of my coming back, to oversleep
himself of a Morning. Also he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
instantly intermitted all the little Share
of my Work that had been put upon him
while I was ill. Seeing me turn white
from Time to Time, he said I was
shamming for the Sake of Soups and
Cordials; and when I went forth with
Mistress <i>Anne</i>, he called me a special
good Nursery-maid. All this I cared for
very little, knowing that when I got
stout, I could soon put him down; but
meantime, 'twas not over-pleasant to be
scoffed at as a languid Lad, who, if
trodden on, could not turn again. One
Day, when some Trifle had made me
start and change Colour,&mdash;I think it was
seeing Mistress <i>Anne</i> go nigh the open
Window,&mdash;he had half pronounced, "You
Coward!" when, suddenly changing his
Mind, he sayth, "Dost know what new
Name I have found for thee, and taught
the Lads along the Bridge? 'The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
Knight of the Flying Leap!'" Which
was humourous, but not well natured.
Howbeit I heard it often enough for
awhile, but as a Title of Distinction
instead of Derision; which incensed the
Author of it.</p>

<p>But all these little Clouds blew over
during the three Weeks I spent with my
Mother at <i>Ashford</i>. When I came back,
I was the same Lad as ever, and took
Things as I found them, and fell into my
old Place.</p>

<p>In the October of this Year, Sir <i>John
Gresham</i>, Mercer, being chosen Mayor,
his Company resolved to get up their
famous Pageant of the Maiden Chariot;
and having vainly cast about among their
own Fraternity for a young Damsel sufficiently
comely to be the Admiration of
all the City, and likewise able and willing
to play the Part of Chariot Maiden,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
they at length offered it to the youngest
Daughter of Master <i>Soper</i> the Barbitonsor
who lived on the Bridge. Now Master
<i>Soper</i> had two Daughters, good and pretty
Girls enow as Times went, <i>Tryphena</i>
and <i>Tryphosa</i> by Name, fresh-coloured,
sprightly, and much admired by the
Bridge 'Prentices. These two Sisters
were seldom apart, inasmuch as both
their Heads might commonly be seen
out of one upper Lattice, looking after
every Thing that passed in the Strete;
and 'twas in their Favour that they always
seemed on the best of Terms with one
another. But whether by Reason of any
Unguent of Master <i>Soper's</i>, or mere Liberality
of Nature, I wot not, the younger,
who in no other Wise excelled her Sister,
was notorious for the excessive Length
and Thickness of her glossy flaxen Hair.
And this being an indispensable Requisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
for the Chariot Maiden, the Mercers
without more Ado offered her the Part,
which she with great Glee accepted.
Now hereupon, I lament to say, ensewed
great Disruption between the twain
hitherto so harmonious; for Public Admiration
of Beauty is as true a Test of
what is the Nature of a Woman's Heart,
as the black Marble the Goldsmiths call
Touchstone is of their precious Metals.
If her Head be not turned by it, good:
if she can bear it bestowed upon another
and o'erlooked in herself, why, good also,&mdash;she
can stand the Touchstone: howbeit,
all have not this Virtue. And,
whereas <i>Tryphosa</i> was now so elate with
thinking of her white satin Gown, her
golden Sandals, her jewelled Crown, and
her Feast in the Hall, as to suppose the
Ground scarce good enow for her to tread
upon, <i>Tryphena</i> was ready to burst with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
Envy of her Sister, and could scarce speak
peaceably unto her. However, she came
to her common Sense and good Feeling
at last, and found her Account in playing
Second; many good Things being in
Store for both. A notable Thing was,
that Master <i>Soper's</i> Shop was now literally
besieged with Customers who wanted to
have a Glimpse of the Chariot Maiden,
insomuch that he said he never had had
such a Trafficking for Pennyworths in
any given Year, as he had in this Month
of October; only the worst was that
every Customer gave as much Trouble
for a Penny as he should have done for
a Shilling, and would hang about, keeping
away fresh Comers, when his Purchase
was made. While <i>Tryphosa</i>, who had
never to this Time shewn any Symptoms
of Shyness, now turned coy and kept herself
close; now and then letting <i>Tryphena</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
flit through the Shop and be mistaken
for her, after which the two would shut
themselves up and go into Fits of Laughter.
The Women all along the Bridge were
out of Patience with her for what they
would have it was simulated Bashfulness
in one who meant to be stared at from
Morn to Night on <i>Lord Mayor's</i> Day.
And they satisfied themselves that she was
shutting herself up for Fear of freckling
or sunburning. As for <i>Miles</i>, who always
loved to do like the rest, he was evermore
running over to Master <i>Soper</i> to have his
Hair cut, till at last it was hardly longer
than the Nap of his Gown; and I almost
think he would have submitted one of his
good white Teeth to the Barber's Pincers,
if he could have gained Admittance on
no cheaper Terms; just to boast of it
afterwards. At last, when the grand Day
came, he and every 'Prentice on the Bridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
mobbed the Barbitonsor's Door till <i>Tryphosa</i>
was fetched away in a close Litter.
Then there was a Rush to the <i>Mercers'</i>
Hall, where Master <i>Gresham</i>, in his Scarlet
and Gold, met his Livery in their new
Gowns furred with Foins and Budge; and
accompanied them, mounted, to <i>Guildhall</i>,
where the late <i>Mayor</i>, <i>Sheriffs</i>, and <i>Aldermen</i>,
met them on Horseback. Then they
all took Barge to <i>Westminster</i> and back,
to the Sound of Trumpets, Sackbuts, and
Shawlms, and the firing of small Guns,
and exploding of Crackers. On re-landing
at <i>Three Cranes' Wharf</i>, they
re-mounted, and proceeded to <i>Paul's
Churchyard</i>, where they met the Pageant,
consisting of an exceeding magnifical
Chariot, twenty-two Feet high, of the
<i>Roman</i> Build, entirely covered with silver
embossed Work, having <i>Tryphosa</i> therein,
set on high, in Jewels and spangled Satin;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
her fair flaxen Tresses dishevelled, a Sceptre
in one Hand, a Shield in the other, with
all the Glory and Majesty possible to
imagine:&mdash;<i>Fame</i>, blowing of a Trumpet
right over her Head, <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Modesty</i>,
and all the rest, including the nine Muses,
each in their proper Places; <i>Triumph</i>,
driving nine white <i>Flanders</i> Horses, three
abreast; Grooms, Lictors, and Pages
marching alongside the Equipage; and a
Score of Salvages and Jacks-i'-the-Green,
making diverting Remarks to all; and
keeping the Crowd off with Squibs and
Crackers.</p>

<p>Oh! was ever Woman exalted one Day
so high (even to the first-floor Windows),
to come down so low into the Retiredness
of domestic Life the next! What was
<i>Cleopatra</i> sailing down the <i>Cydnus</i> to this?
Did <i>Zenobia</i>, did <i>Semiramis</i> ever have anything
so fine in the Way of Triumph?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
Pish!&mdash;Moreover, there was a separate
Table prepared for <i>Tryphosa</i>, who dined
in State with her chosen Ladies, attended
by Seneschals, Squires, and Pages, as if
she had been a Queen. And had
Swans' Pudding and Leche Lombard, I
promise ye!</p>

<p>&mdash;But oh! poor Humanity.&mdash;'Twas
noted at the Feast, more in special by
some of the chosen Ladies that thought
themselves set lower than they might
have been,&mdash;that poor <i>Tryphosa's</i> Face
was so tanned by Exposure all Day to
Sun and Wind, as that my <i>Lord Mayor's</i>
Gown was scarce more Scarlet. And by
the Space of a Fortnight or so from that
Hour, 'twas so blistered and scorched that
she hated to be seen, and was obliged to
blanch and mollify it with Buttermilk,
Cream of Almonds, and I wot not what
Female Recipes. Which was the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
provoking, as some of the inferior Officers
of the Company called, the Day after the
Feast, to know how she fared, and she
was constrained to leave their Entertainment
to <i>Tryphena</i>. <i>Miles</i>, who had a
Glimpse of her through an upper Casement,
was so offended at her Aspect that
he spent no more Pence at Master <i>Soper's</i>.
And by the Fortnight's End, the Matter
had ceased to be talked about, and the
two Girls might be seen, sewing together,
and keeping an Eye to the Bridge, as contentedly
and harmoniously as ever.</p>

<p>During my Visit to my <i>Mother</i>, a new
Inmate had been brought into the Family:
to wit, a superior Kind of Maid for Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, named <i>Damaris</i>, who had lived
aforetime in the Household of Master
<i>Hewet's</i> Brother in the Country. She was
a Miracle of Composedness and discreet
Demeanour, which gave her the Air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
being somewhat older than she really
was. Mistress <i>Anne</i> now spent the Chief
of the Day with her in the Green Lattice,
where <i>Damaris</i> kept herself much reserved,
sewing fine Linen, and teaching her little
Charge to read.</p>

<p>One Day, when I was moving some
Laths and Cases that had stood against
the Wall in <i>Tomkins's</i> Attick till they
were begrimed with Dust, I was in
Amaze to behold delineated on the
White-wash with black Chalk, an exact
Portraicture of <i>Tomkins</i>, stooping over his
Work, with every Line and Furrow of
his intent, earnest Visage accurately made
out.</p>

<p>"What's this?" quod I.</p>

<p><i>Tomkins</i> brake forth into Laughing. "I
wist what you would come to," quod he,
"when you set about moving those Laths.
That's Master <i>Hans Holbein's</i> Handywork.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
He must needs befoul the Wall
with his Scrawling, just after it had
been fresh Lime-washed. I told him
'twas a Pity it had not been scrawled
first, and limewashed afterwards. So,
then, in his Despite, he scored it
through with that Cross; and then I
set the Lumber against it, and told him
Nobody should see it again."</p>

<p>"Who is <i>Hans Holbein</i>?" quod I.</p>

<p>"A prime <i>Flemish</i> Painter," returned
<i>Tomkins</i>; "he tables at the Goldsmith's,
nearer the north End of the Bridge.
When Master <i>Hewet</i> first married, he
had <i>Hans Holbein</i> for a Lodger; and
the Green Lattice was filled from End
to End with his Pictures&mdash;there's a
Bundle of his Scratchings down there
now. Howbeit, he was too boisterous
an Inmate to please Mistress <i>Alice</i>, so
Master <i>Hewet</i> was glad to get quit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
him. There's a famous Thing of his
at <i>Surgeons' Hall</i>; old King <i>Harry</i>
granting the Charter to the Company;
howbeit, though he painted half the
Court, he did nothing better, to my
Mind, than his Likeness of Mistress
<i>Alice</i>, that now hangs at the Foot of
her Husband's Bed. When the Door
standeth ajar, thou mayst see it without
going in."</p>

<p>So, the next Time I passed, I looked
in, and saw the Presentment of my
Master's late Wife. Of a Truth, she
must have been a fair Creature: with
Eyes as blue and truthful as Mistress
<i>Anne's</i>, and sunny Hair that would have
fallen over her fair Shoulders in as heavy
Curls, but for her Matron's Frow's-paste.
Also the same full, cherry Lips, and
dimpled Chin; the same small Nose,
small Ear, small Hand; in fine, the Foreshadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
of what Mistress <i>Anne</i> in After-time
became, rather than what she was
yet.... Pity, so fair a Lady should die
so young!</p>

<p>And she made a good End, <i>Tomkins</i>
told me&mdash;knew 'twas at Hand, took
composed Leave of all, and desired she
might be buried in the Church of St.
<i>Martin Orgar</i>; and that 30<i>s.</i> and no
more should be spent to bury her decently,
and 10<i>s.</i> more for Cakes, Wine,
and Spices for the Mourners. Also 20<i>s.</i>
out of her own private Purse to be put
in the Common-box of the Fraternity for
an Alms; Five Shillings to the mortuary
Priest, and Five Shillings to the Poor in
Bread. Six of the Company bare her to
Church, each of whom received a silver
Spoon.</p>

<p>Somewhere about this Time, the <i>Clothworkers'</i>
new Overseer came to examine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
the Premises; and, when he had concluded
his Inspection below-stairs, told
my Master, with some Hesitation, he had
Reason to think there was a Journeyman
hid away above who worked in the
House. Master <i>Hewet</i> smiled, and told
him of the Exception made in Favour of
<i>Tomkins</i>, and accompanied him up-stairs,
to let him witness for himself that his
Statement was true. When we went in,
<i>Tomkins</i>, for once, was off Duty, intent
upon a Book, and so buried in it, that
he started and blushed like a Boy caught
conning <i>Tom Thumb</i> in School-time.
When the Overseer was gone, <i>Tomkins</i>
sayth to me with a little Dryness, "Who
would have thought of your taking me
by Surprise?"</p>

<p>I made Answer, "Who would have
thought of your being surprised?" at
which he laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
"So," quod he, after weaving a little
While in Silence, "they've set up <i>Erasmus's</i>
Paraphrase, now, alongside of the
chained Bible in St. <i>Magnus's</i>."</p>

<p>"They have it in all the Churches,"
quod I; "but how came you to know
it?"</p>

<p>He was silent awhile, and smiled a
little. "Well," quod he, "thou knowest
I have crawled out a little lately, before
Breakfast; and I thought it as well to
turn into the Church for a Rest; and
found that a Spell of Reading helped
to pass the Time.... I go there o'
Sundays, now: have done so ever since
<i>that Night</i>."</p>

<p>"Then," quod I softly, as I leaned over
him, "<span class="smcap">God</span> <i>hath</i> been merciful to you a
Sinner."</p>

<p>And spake never a Word moe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />&nbsp;<i>Tib's Malpractyzes</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="100" height="107" alt="A"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">As</span>
about this Time, it being
stark Winter, <i>Tib Pyebaker</i>
went near to burn the
House down after the
Manner following. She
took some red-hot Coals between two
Saucepan-lids to warm her Bed therewith;
and, whenas she deemed it heated
enow, she would needs not be at the
Pains of carrying the Coals down again,
but hid them under the Stairs in a
Broom-cupboard. And by Reason of
the undermost Lid-handle making the
Lid to lose its Balance, it fell Topside-t'otherway,
and the lighted Coals were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
spilled, whereof I passing the Cupboard,
was made ware by the strong Smell
of burning. And, looking therein and
moving sundry Rags that were already
Tinder, I found the Boards beneath them
just ready to burst into a Flame. Whereupon,
without running for Water, I cast
my Gown thereon and crushed it out
with my Hands. Now, could I have
hidden my Burns, I might have saved
<i>Tib's</i> Credit; whereas the Thing could
not be hid, seeing I could not so much
as cut my Meat; and Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>
bruiting it abroad, it came to the Ears
of the Bridge Wardens, who, because of
the imperilling of the whole Bridge,
would not be hindered of setting <i>Tib</i> in
the Cage, as a Warning to other careless
Servants. I was grievous for her, the
Place was so publique; and a Lot of
'Prentice Boys were staring at her all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
Day, and offering her Eatables and then
plucking them away. Also <i>Miles</i> made
no end of Pretences for going of Errands
past that End of the Bridge, and always
feigned to look away from <i>Tib</i>, yet
took Care to spy her in her Trouble,
out of the Corner of his Eye, all the
Time.</p>

<p>I never knew one Woman treat another
with more silent Contempt than
<i>Damaris</i> expressed for <i>Tib</i>, after this
Affair of the Cage. It was a long Time
afore the 'Prentices (who now called me
<i>Fire-and-Water</i>,) left off asking of <i>Tib</i>
where she now kept her Warming-pan,
and whether she cast her hot Ashes out
on the Boats that shot the Bridge. For
this, she would sometimes catch them by
the Ears and pull them well; but then
they would cry "Clubs!" and a Score
of Lads were over their Counters in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
Minute, and she had to run for it and
dart breathless into the House, whither
they dared not follow her. Howbeit,
when the pleasant Month of May came,
and the Damsels danced before their
Masters' Doors to the Timbrels, <i>Tib</i>, who
well loved to pound away with the Rest,
was so cross that she would not come
forth.</p>

<p>During the last few Months, <i>Tomkins</i>
had been much eased of his Lameness;
and the worn Look of Suffering had
altogether departed, leaving him a much
younger looking Man than before this
Relief. One day, to my great Surprise,
he told me he was going to be married.
I asked him, to whom; and he said, to
an old Acquaintance of his he had long
lost Sight of, but had fallen in with in
St. <i>Magnus</i>' Church ... one who would
gladly have had him when they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
many Years younger, but who was kind
enough to care for him and wish to make
him happy now. He added, reflectively,
when he had told me this, "There are
a great many good Women in the
World."</p>

<p>So he removed his Loom to a tidy
Lodging in <i>Shoreditch</i>, which Master <i>Hewet</i>
furnished for him; and Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>
gave him his Wedding Dinner, and <i>Miles</i>
and I helped to eat it. The Wife,
though middle-aged, had a pleasant
Aspect; and I thought <i>Tomkins</i> had
done a very good Thing for himself;
but his Attick looked very dreary without
him.</p>

<p>The Marching Watch was revived
with great Splendour this Year by the
Lord Mayor, Sir <i>John Gresham</i>, both on
St. <i>John's</i> Eve, and the Eve of St. <i>Peter</i>:
and the Array was augmented by three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
Hundred Demi-lances and light Horse,
prepared by the City to be sent into
<i>Scotland</i> for the Rescue of the Town of
<i>Haddington</i>. Five Hundred of the Cressets
were furnished by the great Companies,
the other two Hundred by the Chamber
of <i>London</i>, and every Cresset had two
Men, one to hold, and one to trim it:
and every Cresset-bearer had Wages, his
Breakfast, a Badge, and a Straw Hat.
And, what with Halberdiers, Billmen,
etc., there mustered about two Thousand.
There were also many City Feasts, some
of which Master <i>Hewet</i> and Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> attended very richly dressed.</p>

<p>It was some little Time after this, that
I, copying a Letter at my Master's Behest,
could not hinder myself of hearing the
following Address made to him by Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>William</i>, I have been laying up thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
black Velvet Suit with Care, this Morning,
thinking thou wouldest have no
more present Occasion for it.&mdash;How well
thou becamest it, I thought! And so
thought Mistress <i>Beatrix</i>. She said she
had never seen a Man look so well
since thou warest thy white Sarcenet
Coat in the great Muster for King
<i>Harry</i>."</p>

<p>"Sarcenet Speeches, Sister," sayth
Master <i>Hewet</i>.</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not what you mean by
Sarcenet Speeches," returns she, "I am
sure they were sincere enough; and
truly I think, Brother, if you pushed
your Fortune a little in that Quarter,
you might have Success."</p>

<p>Finding he uttered no Word, she, after
a little waiting, saith, "Dear <i>Alice</i> hath
now been long in her Grave, and would,
I am certified, wish you to be happy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
&mdash;"And what is to make me so?"
asks he, huskily.</p>

<p>"Nay, Brother, a good Wife."</p>

<p>"I've had one," quod he, "and one is
enough to my Share.&mdash;Are you tired of
keeping House for me? What would
you do, now, if I set a Lady above you
at my Table?"</p>

<p>"Oh," quod she cheerfully, "I would
gladly take the second Place. Or, if
she preferred my Room to my Company,
I would take Pattern by the old
Lady at the Bridge End that lives all
alone by herself with her Cats."</p>

<p>"No, dear <i>Fraunces</i>" sayth he,&mdash;and
I have Ground for thinking he kissed
her,&mdash;"you shall need neither Alternative&mdash;<i>Alice</i>
shall have no Successor in
mine House, since she can never have
one in my Heart ... and, as to happy,&mdash;why,
except for that one great Loss,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
am I not happy as Man can be? Believe
me, I am content with the Present,
and trustful for the Future. I hope to
see...."</p>

<p>But what he hoped to see, I heard
not.</p>

<p>About this Time, <i>Miles</i> had formed
close Acquaintance with some Lads on
the Bridge, who gave their Masters more
Trouble than enough. I suppose he
thought it spirited of them, and worthy
of all Imitation. One Night, I awoke
out of my first Sleep, and lay listening
to the Uproar of the Winds and Waters,
which seemed quite to drown <i>Miles'</i>
Snoring, when the Door suddenly opened,
and my Master, with a Lamp in his
Hand, sayth, "<i>Ned</i>, are you in Bed?" I
say, "Yes, Master." "Then," quod he,
where is <i>Miles</i>?" I said, "In Bed too,
Master." But he turned his Light on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
<i>Miles'</i> Bed, and it was empty. Then
quod he, "The Bridge Watchman hath
just called under my Window to say
one of my 'Prentices was abroad, but
he wist not which, for in chasing him,
he stumbled over an Heap of Rubbish
before a House under Repair, and lost
him in the Dark."</p>

<p>Then he left me, and I lay wondering
how <i>Miles</i> could have got out, since Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> kept the House-key, and
what Account he would give of himself
when he came back. Master <i>Hewet</i>, I
afterwards learnt, found the Key in the
Door, outside, and took it in, and locked
the Door. And so, sate in Wait a good
While, till at length some one tries
the Door from without, then gropes
about the Ground for the Key, then
loudly whispers through the Keyhole,
"<i>Tib!</i> <i>Tib!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
Thereupon the Door is opened, but
not by <i>Tib</i>; and my Master, collaring
<i>Miles</i>, strikes him, but not so severely
as for him to do what he did, which
was to fall all along on the Ground and
emit one or two hollow Grones. Master
<i>Hewet</i>, witting him to be scarce hurt,
waxed very angry, and pulling him up,
would know how he got out, but <i>Miles</i>
would not tell. Then he would know
why he called on <i>Tib</i> through the Keyhole,
as though expecting her to be at
Hand; and he made Answer, Because
her Name came readiest, and he was less
afeard of her than of any else, but she
wist not of his being out. My Master
said, That should be seen to, and how
did he get the Key? He said Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> had forgotten to take it up.
But Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>, when called up,
remembered well to have laid it on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
Toilette ere she went to Bed, and was
avised <i>Tib</i> must have fetched it while
she was asleep. But, on going to <i>Tib</i>,
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> found her sleeping so
heavily, that after much shaking, all she
could get out of her was, "Thieves!
Thieves!" So the Matter stood over;
Master <i>Hewet</i> putting it to <i>Miles</i> whether
he wist not that he might have him up
before the Wardens, and see him hardly
dealt with. So <i>Miles</i> came back to his
Bed, sullen enough.</p>

<p>But a Woman's own Tongue is oft
her worst Enemy. The next Morning,
though Nothing could be got out of
<i>Miles</i> nor of <i>Tib</i>, yet Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>,
being in her own Bed-chamber, instead
of at Market, as <i>Tib</i> supposed, hears <i>Tib</i>,
who was concluded to be making my
Master's Bed, a talking from his Window
to the Maid in the corresponding Window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
across the Strete. And although, by
Reason of the two Tenements being so
very few Feet apart in their upper Stories,
there was hardly need for <i>Tib</i> to speak
above her Breath, yet Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>,
quickened by Curiosity, could hear almost
every Word, and how that <i>Tib</i> had come
into her Chamber when she was asleep,
and took the Key and lent it to <i>Miles</i>,
who had promised her a tawdry Ribbon
for it: and how the Watchman saw him
go forth, and aroused my Master, who
set on him when he returned, and beat
him within an Inch of his Life. And
how Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>&mdash;But here Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> spoiled all, in her Anxiety to
hear the Particulars of her own Character;
for, advancing a little too near the Casement,
that she might not lose a Syllable,
she was caught Sight of by the Neighbour's
Maid, who, without Doubt, made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
a Signal to <i>Tib</i>. Whereupon, <i>Tib</i>, after
a Moment's Pause, added, and how that
if Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> were not the sweetest
and mercifullest of Ladies, there would
be no Chance of her forgiving such a
Misdeed when she came to hear it, as
<i>Tib</i> meant she should the very first Time
she could find Heart to confess it to the
sweetest and best of Ladies.</p>

<p>Oh what Potence hath a flattering
Tongue! Here was Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>
ready to fly out upon <i>Tib</i> and give her
Warning on the Spot, and, in a Minute,
in a Breath, her Wrath was allayed and
brought within Compass by the Commendation
of an artful Woman. She
goeth to the Stair-foot and calleth,
"<i>Tib!</i> <i>Tib!</i> come down with thee this
Instant!" but by the Time <i>Tib</i> appeared
with her Apron at her Eyes, she
had lost all Mind to cast her, characterless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
forth of the House, and it sufficed
her to bestow a severe Chiding. Whereat
<i>Tib</i> wept, and took Shame to herself, and
made her Peace; and so was kept on.
Which I ever thought an ill-advised
Thing. Where there's no Fidelity, there's
no Safety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />&nbsp;<i>Early Setting of a young Morning Star</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="100" height="107" alt="A"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">And</span>
<i>Jacob</i> served <i>Laban</i> for
<i>Rachel</i> seven Years; and
they seemed unto him
but so many Days, for
the Love he had unto
her." Albeit I was not serving my
Master for my Master's Daughter, yet
her being in the House helped, I
wot, to make the seven Years speed
like seven Days. Sure, never was so
gracious a Creature! Her Nature was
so excellent, and her Countenance, which
was the Index of her Mind, was so
full of Sweetness and Goodness, that
one could scarce look upon her without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
blessing Him who had created her so
lovely.</p>

<p>Meantime my Master's Fortune and
Credit from small Beginnings had risen
mightily, as is often the Case in this
commercial and prosperous City. He
had gone through the three Degrees of
Wardenship of his Company, had been
elected of the Common Council, and
was now Alderman of the Bridge Ward
Without. And if he still lived and
went plain, he laid by and laid out in
Commerce the more: there was no Shew,
nor no Stinting.</p>

<p>Yes: those were happy Days! All
the fairer they seem now, for the dark
ones that were coming. The only Sorrow
among us that I remember was when the
Pestilence brake out, in the fifth Year of
our young King, which at first only prevailed
in the North, but at length reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
<i>London</i>, where it raged with prodigious
Fury, carrying off eight Hundred Souls
the first Week, and mostly after a Sickness
of only twelve or twenty-four Hours.
We had it not on the Bridge, which was
attributed to the free Access of fresh
Air to our Dwellings; howbeit, Mistress
<i>Anne</i> (like a ministering Angel as she
was,&mdash;such a Child, too! only in her
twelfth Year!) must needs go about, relieving
poor Wretches in their Dwellings;
whereby she caught a low Fever that
brought her to Death's Door, and filled
the House with Tears. If my Master,
a Man in Years, forbare not to weep,
Reason was, a Lad such as I should
weep too. Howbeit, through the Grace
of God, she recovered: but for a long
Time she was too enfeebled to walk,
wherefore Master <i>Hewet</i> took her much
on the Water during the long Summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
Evenings, after we had been nigh stifled
by the Day's sultry Heat. For the eastern
Side of the House was close; and the
western, though open, yet was much
exposed to the Glare of the Sun on the
River. We shut it out with Blinds and
Lattices all we could; but still, the
Crown of the Day was after Sundown
on the Water. Master <i>Hewet</i> liked his
'Prentices to pull; and sometimes we
fell into the Wake of some Court Barge
with Horns and Sackbuts, and lay on our
Oars; Mistress <i>Anne</i> full silent, resting
her Head, for Weakness, against my
Master's Shoulder, and with the Tears
sometimes stealing down from her large,
bright Eyes. My Master carried her
down to the Boat, but 'twas my Portion,
for I will not say Burthen, to carry her
up. How light she was! She did not
much like it, and managed presently to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
ascend slowly, with the help of my
Master's Arm; but I remember the
Goodness and Sweetness with which,
with a sweet Blush on her Face, she
sayth, "Do you remember the first
Time? But for thee, I had not been
here now."</p>

<p>As she strengthened, we kept out
longer, and went up to <i>Chelsea</i> and
<i>Fulham</i>, and rambled about the pleasant
Fields; eating Curds and Cream at Milkhouses,
and returning by Moonlight;
<i>Miles</i> and I singing, "Row the Boat,
<i>Norman</i>."</p>

<p>Then Master <i>Hewet</i> carried her down
into the Country, to the Hall of his
Brother the Squire; and there she abode
till she was quite well. When she returned,
the Leaves were falling, and
Master <i>Hewet</i> would walk with her of
an Evening to <i>Finsbury Fields</i>, and stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
with her at a Distance to see us young
Men shoot the long Bow, leap, wrestle,
cast the Stone, and practise our Shields;
in all which, <i>Miles</i> came in for his full
Share of Praise; and I was always well
content to be thought equal to him.
Sometimes I overshot him, sometimes
he overshot me; sometimes I outleaped
him, sometimes he outleaped me; but
we loved the Game beyond the Competition;
there was never any ill Blood
between us.</p>

<p>'Twas on <i>All Saints'</i> Day, this Year,
that the new Service Book, called of
Common Prayer, was first used in <i>Paul's</i>
Church, and the like throughout the
whole City. Dr. <i>Ridley</i>, Bishop of <i>London</i>,
performed the same in <i>Paul's</i>, in his
Rochet only; and in the Afternoon
preached at <i>Paul's</i> Cross before the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen, and Livery Companies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
which Sermon, being on the Subject of
the new Service, lasted till five o' the
Clock, so that, the Days being short, we
returned by Torch-light.</p>

<p>Then had the Church great Rest.
The Enemy, knowing his Time was at
Hand, lay mighty quiet: and, for the
Multitude of notable Foreigners that
resorted to us for Safeguard, <i>England</i>
might have been called <i>Christi Asylum</i>.
Howbeit, the Canker was already i' the
Bud!</p>

<p>The King, earlier in the Year, had
ta'en the Measles; and during the
Summer, had ridden a Progress with
greater Magnificence than ever he had
done before. In the <i>January</i> following,
whether procured by sinister Practice or
natural Infirmity, he fell into an Indisposition
of Body which soon grew to a
Cough of the Lungs. Perhaps it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
been happy if Lord <i>Robert Dudley</i> (now
my Lord of <i>Leicester</i>,) had not recently
been sworn one of the six Gentlemen of
the King's Chamber ... we must not
speak ill, <i>Hew</i>, of them that are set high
in Authority, save upon great Conviction
and Certitude: howbeit, you and I know
what the private Report of that Gentleman
is&mdash;When I'm sick, don't give me a
<i>Leicester Cordial</i>, that's all!</p>

<p>The common Talk was, that a poisoned
Nosegay had been given the pretty Boy
at New-year's-tide, which brought him
into this slow but deadly Languishment.
To think, what Poison may lie 'neath
Flowers! At all Events, the Duke of
<i>Northumberland</i>, now the powerfullest
Man in the Realm since he had swallowed
up his unhappy Rival <i>Somerset</i>,
beginneth to aim at nothing short of
Crown matrimonial for his young Son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
Lord <i>Guilford Dudley</i>, lately espoused to
the Lady <i>Jane Grey</i>; therefore inculcateth
on the kingly Boy now a-dying, how
much it concerned him to have a Care
for Religion, not only during Life, but
after his Death; which could not be
preserved in its Purity to the Realm
should the Lady <i>Mary</i> succeed; and, if
he set aside one Sister, he might as well
put away the other also, and devise his
Crown to her who after them was his
next Kinswoman, the good and godly
Lady <i>Jane</i>.</p>

<p>So soon as this was obtained of him,
he might die as soon as he would&mdash;the
sooner the better&mdash;and, to help Matters,
the Leeches were dismissed, and a Gentlewoman
(thought to have received her
Instructions before hand,) set over him;
under whose Applications his Pulse presently
failed, his Skin changed Colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
and other Symptoms speedily appeared
of Mortal Dissolution. Turning his Face
then to the Wall like good <i>Hezekiah</i>, he
was heard by one that sate behind the
Curtain to say, "O <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>, deliver
me out of this miserable and wretched
Life! O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou knowest how
happy it were for me to be with thee;
yet, for thy Chosen's Sake, if it be thy
Will, send me Life and Health that I
may truly serve thee!" After a little
Space, again he sigheth, "O save thy
People <i>England</i>!" Then, turning about,
and noting some one behind the Curtain,
"I had thought," saith he, "I was alone."
"Sir," sayth the Attendant, "I heard you
speak, but heard not what you were
saying." "Nay," sayth he, "I was
but praying to <span class="smcap">God</span>. Oh! I am faint!
faint unto Death! <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, receive my
Spirit!" And forthwith breathed out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
his white, innocent Soul. Early ripe,
early gathered!</p>

<p>Thus we sometimes see the Nation's
prime Hope, the Desire of all Eyes, cut
off as a sweet Rose snaps its Stalk; and
we mourn, thinking the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> hath forgotten
to be gracious and will no more
be entreated, and his Mercy is clean gone
from us for ever; not knowing that, after
he hath tried and purified his own, yea,
like Silver over the Fire, till the thick
Scum separates and he seeth his own
Image reflected in the bright Metal, he
will return unto us and be gracious, like
as a Father pitieth his Children, and
make our latter Day better than our
Beginning. Had we not known the
early Setting of this young <i>Hesperus</i>, we
had not now sunned ourselves in the
Light of our bright Occidental Star.</p>

<p>And now, the bright Boy being dead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
the Duke of <i>Northumberland</i> took upon
him to sit at the Stern, and order all
Things according unto his Pleasure. The
Demise of the Crown was kept close that
Day and the next, he hoping to obtain
Possession of the Lady <i>Mary</i>, who, however,
learned the Secret, and rode off to
the Coast. Meantime, he took heed to
occupy and fortify the <i>Tower</i>; and, on the
second Day, sent for the Lord Mayor,
six Aldermen, not including Master <i>Hewet</i>,
six Merchants of the Staple, and as
many Merchant Adventurers, to attend
the Council at <i>Greenwich</i>, where they
were advised of the King's Death and
how he had ordained for the Succession
by Letters Patent, to the which they
were sworn, and charged to keep the
Matter secret.</p>

<p>When my Master presently heard of
this from one of his brother Aldermen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
(for such Secrets are not long kept,) he
said, in his own Family, that however
he might desire a Protestant Succession,
he was persuaded that this would not,
nor could not, come to Good. "To say
Nothing," quod he, "of the Lady
<i>Jane's</i> questionable Birth; for the
Duke, though few know it, had, when
he married her Mother, a Wife living
already."</p>

<p>Howbeit, at Three o' the Clock on
the Monday Afternoon, the Lady <i>Jane</i>
was conveyed, in Sight of us all, by
Water from <i>Syon</i> to the <i>Tower</i>, and there
received as Queen. At Five o' Clock,
the King's Death and her Accession were
proclaimed; but few cried "<span class="smcap">God</span> save
Queen <i>Jane</i>!" A Drawer at a Tavern
within <i>Ludgate</i> said in the Hearing of
some, that he thought the Lady <i>Mary</i>
had the better Title; whereon he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
incontinent arrested and set in the Pillory
in <i>Chepe</i>, whereto both his Ears were
nailed, and then clean cut off.</p>

<p>Meantime the Duke of <i>Northumberland</i>
heareth that the Lady <i>Mary's</i> Party makes
head, whereon he resolves to send Lady
<i>Jane's</i> Father, the Duke of <i>Suffolk</i>, to put
it down and seize her Person. Whereon
the Lady <i>Jane</i>, who hath all along had
no Mind to the Crown, weepeth sore,
and begs her Father may be let off that
Enterprize and that her Father-in-law
will take it on himself; which he, after
short Demur and much Flattery of his
Bravery and Skill, consenteth to do.
But his Heart misgiveth him, both as
to what he goes to and what he leaves
behind; and, sayth he to the Council,
"Should ye in mine Absence waver in
your Resolution, it may be ye will
contrive your own Safety with my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
Destruction." Quod they, "Your Grace
makes a Doubt of that which cannot
be, for which of us all can wash his
Hands clean of this Business?" So
the Duke set forth with eight Thousand
Foot and two Thousand Horse; and, as
he rode along <i>Shoreditch</i>, quod he to Lord
<i>Grey</i>, "See how the People press forward
to see us! but not one of them sayth,
'<span class="smcap">God</span> speed you!'"</p>

<p>In Truth, Gentle and Simple fell off
to the Lady <i>Mary</i>, though Bishop <i>Ridley</i>
preached at <i>Paul's</i>, to invite us to stand
firm to Lady <i>Jane</i>. The Duke's Party
melted away; and the Duke of <i>Suffolk</i>,
learning how his Daughter's Partizans
had defalked to the Lady <i>Mary</i> or
been defeated and captivated, entereth
the young Queen's Chamber and telleth
her in brief, she must now put off her
royal Robes and be content with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
private Life. To which the meek young
Lady made Answer, that she should put
them off with more Contentation than
she had put them on; and would never
have done so but to please him and her
Mother. And so ended her ten Days'
Reign.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />&nbsp;<i>The Defence of the Bridge</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="100" height="105" alt="O"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">On</span>
the Third of <i>August</i>, the
Lady <i>Mary</i> entered <i>London</i>
as <i>Mary</i> the <i>Queen</i>; and
truly she began to make
short Work of it; for, the
next Day, she restored <i>Gardiner</i> to his
Bishopric of <i>Winchester</i>, and, a few Days
later, made him <i>Chancellor</i>; and, on the
Fifth, restored <i>Bonner</i> and <i>Tunstall</i> to
their Sees. <i>Ridley</i>, <i>Coverdale</i>, <i>Hooper</i>, and
the rest of our good reformed Bishops, of
course, were removed; and all beneficed
Men that were married, or would not
abjure the reformed Faith, were put out
of their Livings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
On the <i>13th</i>, <i>Miles</i> and I went to hear
what would be said at <i>Paul's Cross</i>.
There was one <i>Bourne</i>, a Canon, who
preached such arrant <i>Romanism</i> and
Flattery of <i>Bonner</i>, now Bishop of <i>London</i>,
to his Face, that the People hooted and
cried, "Pull him down," and <i>Miles</i>,
flinging his Cap with good Aim, hit him
on the Nose. Another flung a Dagger,
which just missed him, but caused him
to quit his Post; and honest Master
<i>Bradford</i>, stepping into it, spread forth
his Hands with, "Good <i>Christian</i> People"&mdash;whereon
there was great Quiet; and
by his savoury and peaceifying Doctrine
he allayed the Tumult. The same Day,
an old Priest said Mass at St. <i>Bartholomew's</i>,
albeit the People went nigh to pull him
in Pieces.</p>

<p>The following <i>Sunday</i>, one Dr. <i>Watson</i>
preached at <i>Paul's Cross</i>, and the Churchyard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
was lined with Soldiers, for Fear of
like Tumult that was on the <i>Sunday</i> before.
During the Week, <i>Northumberland</i> had
been arraigned and condemned; and on
the <i>Monday</i> next following he was to be
beheaded; howbeit, he desired first to
hear Mass and receive the Sacrament
after the <i>Romish</i> Manner: thereby looking,
maybe, to obtain Pardon, but in sooth
only proving a Renegade and losing the
Grace of a Confessor. The Lady <i>Jane</i>,
looking forth of her Prison Window,
saw him on his Way to Mass; a grievouse
Thing to her pure Mind; whereof she
spake next Day at Table, saying, "Wo
worth him! Should I that am young
and in my few Yeres, forsake my Faith
for the <span class="smcap">Love</span> of Life? Much more he
should not, whose fatal Course could
not long have lasted."</p>

<p>On the <i>14th Sept.</i> good Master <i>Latimer</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
was sent Prisoner to the Tower. Seeing
a Warder there whose Face he remembered,
he cried cheerily, "What, old
Friend! how do you? See, I am come
to be your Neighbour again!" The
good <i>Cranmer</i> was committed thither the
same Day. But these Things were done
privately: a Boat, more or less, privily
shooting the Bridge and gliding aneath
the Traitors' Arch, was ta'en no Note of;
while the Stretes and Highways were all
astir with Preparations for the Queen's
Crownation, which was set for the <i>1st
Octr.</i> The <i>Easterlings</i> were providing
her a mighty fine Pageant, at <i>Gracechurch
Corner</i>, with a little Condyt that ran
Wine: the <i>Genouese</i> had theirs in <i>Phanechurchstrete</i>,
the <i>Florentines</i> at the farther
End of <i>Gracechurchstrete</i>, with an Angel
in Green and Gold, that, at pulling of a
String, set a Trumpet to his Mouth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
made believe to blow it,&mdash;only a real
Trumpeter stood behind. With these
and such-like Toys the City amused their
Minds, and humoured themselves into
receiving the Queen with due Loyalty.</p>

<p>But when she came forth ... alas!
what an ill-favoured Lady! Sure, we are
all as <span class="smcap">God</span> made us, for Homeliness or
Comeliness; but yet a sweet Nature may
be discerned through the plainest Favour;
but it could not be discerned here. And
she declined her Head upon her Hand,
as though for some Ache or Ail that
constrained her to regard Everything done
in her Honour askance and awry. 'Tis
Pity o' my Life! when a Lady is so ill
at Ease, she can't hold her Head strait
on her Crownation-day. Doubtless
crowned Heads are liable to Aches as
well as those that own ne'er a Cap; and
'tis a heaven-sent Immunity when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
are able as well as willing for all Public
Occasions, like our Royal Lady that now
rules the Land. With Bone-fires and
Feastings, there were many private Families
enjoyed that Day more heartily, I
wot, than the Queen's Grace in her Chair
of State. The Ceremonial was spun out
beyond all Reason; and when she returned,
'twas with the three Swords of
the three Kingdoms borne sheathed before
her, and another unsheathed&mdash;alack! not
the <i>Sword of the Spirit</i>.</p>

<p>Old Master <i>Cheke</i> dined with us next
Day ... he was now a withered little
old Man, with a frosty Bloom still on his
thin Cheek, but no Fire in his Eye. He
was mighty cast down at the late Imprisonment
of his Nephew, who, though
now set at large, had had a narrow
Escape of it, and behoved to lie close.
Wherefore, to the old Man's Thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
all Joy had vanished, the Mirth of the
Land was gone: and he took up his
Parable and prophesied evil Things.</p>

<p>"And who knows not," quod he,
"whether we shall not shortly have a
<i>Romish</i> King set over us? The Queen
is in Love to Death with <i>Reginald Pole</i>;
and although he will none of her, he
may not be able to resist a matrimonial
Crown. We shall have him sent for
presently, and released from his <span class="smcap">Vows</span>,
as sure as <i>London Bridge</i> is built on
Wool-packs."</p>

<p>Well I wot Master <i>Cheke</i> had the
Truth on't. For the Queen's Grace,
being now seven an' thirty Year old, had
no Time to lose, if she minded to marry
at all; and <i>Reginald Pole</i>, albeit now in
his fifty-fourth Year, was the very handsomest
Man of his Time; more by Token
<i>Michael Angiolo</i> (the greater Shame to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
him!) had put in his Face for that of
our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> in his Scholar's famous
Picture of the Raising of <i>Lazarus</i>.
Howbeit, e'en a Queen, it seemeth, may
woo in vain. She sent for <i>Pole</i> with a
legatine Power, and moreover writ private
Letters unto him and to the <i>Pope</i> with
her own Hand. But, albeit the <i>Pope</i>
rejoiced in his Heart at the Thought of
regaining <i>England</i>, <i>Pole</i> gave such manifest
Signals of hanging back until the
Queen were married, as that her Grace
without more Ado entertained Proposals
from <i>Philip</i> of <i>Spain</i>; she having, thirty
Years before, been promised to his
Father!</p>

<p>This Year, Master <i>Hewet</i> was made
<i>Sheriff</i>. Well remember I young Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, tripping down from her Closet in
sky-blue Taffeta, and flirting a little
Feather-fan as she passed me, crying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
"Make Way for the <i>Sheriff's</i> Daughter!
Oh, <i>Ned</i>, how grand I am!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse quote">'Thereof the Mayor he was full fain,</div>
  <div class="verse">An' eke the Sheriff also&mdash;'"</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I said, "Sure, Mistress, the <i>Sheriff</i> in that
Song came to no Good&mdash;I wist not ye
had so much Pride."</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/161-img.jpg" width="400" height="530" alt="Way"/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="small cursive">J J</p>
    <p class="cursive">"Make way for the Sheriff's Daughter"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>She looked about on me with her
sweet, smiling Face, and said, "I've no
Pride for myself, <i>Edward</i>, but I may
have for him!&mdash;May I not? may I
not?" playfully calling after me as I
turned away. I said, "Oh, forsooth,
Mistress, ye can do no Wrong."</p>

<p>"Is that in jest or earnest?" saith
she, growing serious. "Am I proud,
<i>Edward</i>?"</p>

<p>When I saw her wistful Look, and
thought within me how much indeed
she had to be both proud and vain of,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
yet was neither, I could carry it no
farther, but said, "In sooth, sweet Mistress,
you are not."</p>

<p>"All's right then," quod she gaily,
and hastened to the Window to see the
new Sheriff mount his gray Horse, richly
caparisoned. Thereafter, <i>Miles</i> and I attended
her and Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> to the
River Stairs, where the Company were
to embark on a Pleasure-party; I thought
the Barge had a goodly and lovely
Freight!</p>

<p>Meantime, the Rumour of the Queen's
Match occasioned great Murmuring
throughout the Land. And Sir <i>Thomas
Wyat</i>, a <i>Kentish</i> Gentleman, concerted
with the Duke of <i>Suffolk</i> and Sir <i>Peter
Carew</i> to take Arms and promote a
general Rising, so soon as the <i>Prince</i> of
<i>Spain</i> should set Foot on <i>English</i> Ground.
The Duke, no Doubt, looked for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
Re-establishment of his Daughter, Lady
<i>Jane</i>, now under Sentence, but allowed
the Liberty of the Tower. Sir <i>Thomas</i>,
Son to that <i>Wyat</i> of <i>Allington Castle</i> who
writ good Verses, had oft been Ambassadour
to <i>Spain</i>, where the Cruelty and
Subtlety of the People made him tremble
at the Thought of their obtaining a Footing
in his native Land. But alack! <i>Hew</i>,
how many crying Evils must conspire
together to give any just Pretence for
a Rising against constituted Authorities!
And a defeated Rebellion always
strengthens the Hands of Government.
So it was in this Instance. We had
not as yet been visited with Scourges
nor whipped with Scorpions; 'twas only
the Fear of what might be, (presaged,
'tis true enough, by many Foretokens,)
that tempted Men to shed Blood and endanger
their Heads for the Sake of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
Country. Wherefore, a Bird of the Air,
I suppose, carrying the Matter, Sir <i>Peter
Carew</i>, finding the Plot bewrayed, takes
Thought only for himself, and flies over
Seas; and <i>Wyat</i>, thinking the Hour unripe,
yet purposing rather to hurry forward
than retreat, taketh Arms with the
declared Aim of doing no Hurt to the
Queen's Person, but of removing her evil
Counsellors.</p>

<p>Thereon the City was all Confusion.
Though the 'Prentices had pelted the
<i>Spanish</i> Ambassadours with Snow-balls,
and elder People had spoken against
them under their Breath, yet that natural
Loyalty there is in the City, save under
the most aggravating Circumstances, drew
every one together to make common
Cause with the Queen so soon as 'twas
bruited that <i>Wyat</i> was up in <i>Kent</i>. Five
hundred of the Trained Bands were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
forthwith sent out against him, and the
City began to be kept with harnessed
Men.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor, this Year, was Sir
<i>Thomas White</i>, Merchant-taylor; he that
founded St. <i>John's</i> College, <i>Oxford</i>. To
him, at the <i>Guildhall</i>, cometh my Lord
Treasurer, and prayeth him to have at
the least two thousand Men in Harness
at all Hours, for the Safeguard of the
City. Now begin the young Men of
every Degree to look out and furbish
their Arms and Accoutrements; and the
Hum of Preparation is heard throughout
the Stretes. Post following hot upon
Post bringeth Tidings that the Duke of
<i>Suffolk</i> in <i>Warwickshire</i>, having with all
his Industry gotten together but fifty
Men, had given up the Game and betaken
himself to a Tenant of his, who
kept him three Days hid in a hollow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
Oak till he was taken; but that <i>Wyat</i>,
with at least four thousand Men, (some
made it fourteen thousand,) was marching
fast upon <i>Southwark</i>, and the Trained
Bands had gone over to him, which
caused the Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>, sent against
him, to retreat.</p>

<p>Here then was a Prospect for the
Bridge! the only Access by which he
could command the City. Thou shouldst
have seen the Duke ride back, all crestfallen,
with his Guard at his Heels, all
smirched and tatterdemoiled, without
Arrows or Strings to their Bows, or a
Sword to their Sides, or a Cap to their
Heads. Some of the Urchins cried after
them, "A <i>Wyat</i>! a <i>Wyat</i>!" and got well
cuffed for their Pains.</p>

<p>Then came the News of a Rising in
<i>Hertfordshire</i>. On this the Queen cometh
to <i>Guildhall</i>, with the Lord Chancellor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
and all her Council, guarded by a notable
Company of Men at Arms; and, bespeaking
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, she
pleaded sore they would stand by her
against the Arch-traitor that aimed at
removing her Counsellors and having the
Custody of her Person; affirming and
alleging that she would never once have
entertained thought of her Marriage, had
it not been infused into her by others that
'twas expedient for the Country. When
I heard Master <i>Hewet's</i> Report of her
Argument, I remembered the Saying of
Master <i>Askew</i> the Draper to Lord <i>Warwick's</i>
Man, 'That the City could sometimes
better spare the Court than the
Court the City.'</p>

<p>They protested they would stand by
her&mdash;could they do less? And forthwith,
Proclamation was made to this Effect:&mdash;Now
then, let every Man that is disaffected,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
and every Man that is faint-hearted,
and every Man that is of unstable Mind,
be off as fast as he can. There's <i>Wyat</i>
ready to welcome all Well-wishers, coming
along the <i>Kent Road</i>; and <i>London Bridge</i>
is just now open to all those that like to
join him, which it will not be to-morrow;
for the Draw-bridge is going to be sawn
asunder and cast into the River, the Gates
are going to be shut, the Gate-houses are
going to be manned, the Cannons are
going to be planted to defend them and
to take the Range of the <i>Borough</i>, the
Lord Mayor and Sheriffs in Harness are
going to stand immediately behind the
Gate, and every Man on the Bridge will
close his Windows and stand in his Door
with his 'Prentices armed and ready to do
Battle. <span class="smcap">God</span> save the Queen!</p>

<p>Not many crossed the Bridge after that.
Those that did were glad to explain 'twas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
on necessary and lawful Business, or they
got hooted and sometimes pelted. The
Lord Mayor went with my Master into
every House, to see its Condition and
Defence. When they reached the Door
of the old Lady that lived all by herself
alone with her Cats, they could gain no
Entrance, nor hear Sound of Life within
save a dismal Mewing. Master <i>Hewet</i>
was for departing, saying he believed the
House safe enough though its Owner was
shy of Strangers; but my Lord Mayor
said a silent House was not always the
safest, and there might be Spies and even
harnessed Men shut up. So they persisted
knocking; and at length a skinny old
Woman, all trembling with Fear, peered
forth and would wit what 'twas all about.
When they told her the Bridge was going
to be put in a State of Defence for Queen
<i>Mary</i>, she cried, "<span class="smcap">God</span> save her sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
Majesty!" and let them in, shutting and
bolting the Door behind them. She
sayth, "Oh! Sirs, I see ye be loyal and
honourable Gentlemen, well affected to
our blessed Queen, wherefore I fear not
to trust you with my Secret&mdash;howbeit,
I am not the only one in this House."</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor gave a quick Look at
Master <i>Hewet</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;"I was, you must know," continued
she, "Sub-prioress of a small religious
House at <i>Mickleham</i> in <i>Surrey</i> ... there
were but six of us; we were harmless
and happy enough; howbeit, the Eighth
<i>Harry</i>, that called himself Defender of
our Faith, turned us out Neck and Heels
when he put down the lesser Monasteries;
and my Father, to whom this
House belonged, gave me Shelter in it
during his Life, and left it to me at his
Death. Whereby I have been enabled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
to give House-room and Board to my
aged Superior, who otherwise would
have been cast into the Strete, through
all the evil Times; none witting she
was under my Roof. And now that
better Days are come, she is past any
Advantage of them, being long Time
bed-rid, as ye shall see."</p>

<p>So she hobbled up-stairs before them,
followed by her half-dozen Cats, and led
the Way into a Chamber having a bright
Wood Fire kindled on the Hearth, but
nearly bare of Furniture, beyond a Chair,
a Table, a Crucifix, and a Couple of
Tressel-beds, on one of which lay an old
Woman, sleeping, on the utmost Verge of
Life. She mutely pointed to her, then
led them over the rest of the House,
which was utterly disfurnished and chiefly
shut up; she having got rid of the Moveables
for what they would fetch, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
the Agency of her only Confidant, Sir
<i>Tobias</i>. So now you have the Story of
the old Lady that was supposed to live
all alone by herself with her Cats.</p>

<p><i>Miles</i>' black Eyes kindled like Coals at
the Thought of defending the Bridge....
I confess I felt a Glow within me, and
handled my Bill and Bow with exceeding
Complacence. The Mayor complimented
my Master on having a Couple of such
smart Lads, and said his Premises would
be well defended. Also he said he wished
he had such a fair Daughter as Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, who served him with Bread and
Wine.</p>

<p>If the Queen were ever popular, it was
that Time! What joyous Smiles and
brisk Words were exchanged as People
ran along the Bridge!&mdash;what Glory attended
the Guards that manned the
Gates!&mdash;how we revelled in every Blow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
that cut down the Draw-bridge! Splash!
it went into the River. Spontaneously
we gave three Cheers. Just before the
Approach was cut off, Lord <i>William
Howard</i>, (since, Lord <i>Howard</i> of <i>Effingham</i>,)
with fifty of his Men, rode over
the Bridge to St. <i>George's</i> Church, <i>Southwark</i>,
to note the State of Things, and so
back. I remember his looking gaily over
his Shoulder as he passed, crying out in
Hearing of us all, "This Bridge hath
to-day a Chance of being the <i>Thermopylæ</i>
of <i>London</i>!"</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>A Messenger from the Rebels came to
parley, and was led blindfold across the
Bridge, to and from Lord <i>Pembroke</i>, Commander
in Chief.</p>

<p>On <i>Saturday</i> Morning, <i>Wyat</i> was proclaimed
Traitor, and a Price set on his
Head. There was a grand Muster of
Horse and Foot in <i>Finsbury Fields</i>. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
three in the Afternoon, <i>Wyat</i> advanced
upon <i>London</i> from <i>Deptford</i>; and, as soon
as his Movement was perceived, an eight
Pounder was levelled at him from the
White Tower, the Shot of which took
none Effect. Immediately my Lord
Mayor and the Sheriffs made Haste to
<i>London Bridge</i>: we gave them three Cheers.
The Strete was presently choaked; People
removing their Stalls and Wares, Shop
Shutters putting up, young Men running
up and down to Weapons and Harness,
young Women beginning to shed Tears,
Children and Maids shutting themselves
up in the upper Stories.</p>

<p>My Hands trembled so with Emotion
I could scarce fasten a Buckle. Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, passing, sayth, "Let me do it for
you&mdash;Ladies of old Time buckled on
Knights' Harness and bade them good
Speed, as I bid you.... But oh! <i>Ned</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
I am in Fear for my <i>Father</i>." I said,
"But he hath no Fear, unless for you.
Therefore look not forth; the only
Danger is in a random Shot."</p>

<p>Then she asked me what I thought
would happen if the worst came to the
worst. I told her I had not thought
about it, so sure was I the best would
come to the best. She said she thought
so too; at least she hoped so; and bade
me tell every Word of News I heard
through the Wicket. Presently I heard
that <i>Wyat</i>, with his Army, was close
beyond the further Bridge Gate; and
had pointed two Pieces of Ordnance
against the Bridge: which I thought
needless to tell Mistress <i>Anne</i>.</p>

<p>He was a fine Fellow, <i>Hew</i>, in his
Way, there's no gainsaying. He thought
to free his Country from Harm; and,
when he heard a Price was set upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
Head, he wrote his Name on a Slip of
Paper and set it on his Cap.</p>

<p>My Master was a-foot and in Harness
on the Bridge all Night. The Women
kept close and quite still above-stairs,
while <i>Miles</i> and I kept Watch below,
but, I wot, they were as wakeful as ourselves.
Towards Daydawn my Master
comes in: Mistress <i>Anne</i>, in her white
Wrapper over her Dress, leans over the
Rail at the Stair-head, and cryeth, "Is
all well?" "All well, my Heart!"
returns her Father. "Oh! thank <span class="smcap">God</span>,"
cries she; and meeting him half-way
down the Stair, casts herself into his
Arms.</p>

<p>'Twas <i>Sunday</i> Morning; and maybe, a
Day of much Prayer, if of little Church-going:
but scarcely a Day of Rest. A
Banner of Defiance was unfurled a-top of
the Tower, and a heavy Piece of Ordnance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
discharged when they changed the
Watch.</p>

<p>Lord <i>Howard</i> was walking to and fro
on the Bridge, his Sword clanking at
every firm, heavy Tread; and anon he
goeth to the Gate at the <i>Southwark</i> End,
and calleth in a loud, determined Voice,
"<i>Wyat!</i>"</p>

<p>Presently some one makes Answer,
"What would ye with him?"</p>

<p>"I would speak with him," sayth my
Lord.</p>

<p>Answereth the other, "Our Captain is
busy; if ye have any Message for him,
I will bear it."</p>

<p>"Marry," sayth my Lord, "ask of him
what he meaneth by this Invasion; and
whether he continue in his Purpose
or no."</p>

<p>The Messenger departed; and in about
three Quarters of an Hour returned with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
a weighted Purse, containing Master
<i>Wyat's</i> Answer; which, being flung over
the Gate, was received and read by my
Lord, who tare it up, as good for Nought.
On the <i>Saturday</i> Afternoon, all Boats had
been brought to the City Side of the
River, not to be taken therefrom on Pain
of Death.</p>

<p>My Lord <i>Howard</i> turning in to our
House about Noon, for Refreshment,
looketh fixedly on <i>Miles</i>, and sayth, "So
you are young <i>Osborne</i>." "No, my
Lord," quod I, stepping forward, "I am
he;" thinking he had Somewhat to say
unto me; but he only looked hard at me,
and said "Oh."</p>

<p>At Table, my Master helping him to
Wine, he sayth, "That is a rare Brilliant
on your little Finger, Master
<i>Hewet</i>&mdash;may I be favoured with a
nearer View of it?" "My Lord," sayth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
Master <i>Hewet</i>, "it is a Token-ring: I
never take it off.&mdash;However," quod he
presently, "you shall see it, and read the
Posy inside; connecting it with the
Matter we spake of just now." I noted
a singular Smile on my Lord <i>Howard's</i>
Face as he returned it.</p>

<p>That Night, like the last, was spent in
Harness, but passed not, like the last,
without Event. The Weather was piercing
cold; and a good Watch-fire was
kept up just within the Gate, whereat my
Lord <i>Howard</i>, Sir <i>Andrew Judd</i>, the <i>Lord
Mayor</i>, Master <i>Hewet</i>, and others, stood and
warmed themselves. Meantime, Master
<i>Wyat</i>, anxious to reconnoitre, breaks down
the Wall of a House adjoining the Gate
on his side the Draw-bridge, by which
Breach he ascendeth the Leads of the
Gate-house, and thence coming down into
the Porter's Lodge, it being about eleven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
o' the Clock, he findeth the Porter sleeping,
but his Wife, with sundry others,
watching over a Fire of Coals. On beholding
<i>Wyat</i> they suddenly started; but
he commanded them to keep quiet as they
valued their Lives, and they should sustain
no Hurt; so they having no Courage
to oppose him, he went forth of the other
Side the Gate-house to look across to the
Bridge. There, beyond the Chasm, within
the second Gate, he noteth my <i>Lord
Deputy</i>, the <i>Lord Mayor</i>, and the Rest
standing about the Fire in their Clokes.
After noting them well, and seeing there
was no Hope of taking them by Surprise,
he returneth whence he came, and doeth
his Party to wit how the City strengthened
itself and is on the Alert. Peradventure
to make farther Proof thereof, the
Men of <i>Kent</i> thereon made an Uproar as
it were in Sign of assaulting the Bridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
and fired two Field Pieces. Whereat we
were all alive and to Arms in an Instant;
and the Cries that ran along the Bridge
shewed the Insurgents we were ready for
them.</p>

<p>On <i>Monday</i> we were heartened, and
doubtless <i>Wyat</i> was disheartened, by the
Bruit of Lord <i>Abergavenny's</i> marching
upon him from <i>Blackheath</i> with three
Thousand Men. Thereon ensewed Diversity
of Councils, in the End whereof,
Master <i>Wyat</i> decided to march along the
<i>Thames</i> next Day, to get Access to <i>Middlesex</i>
by <i>Kingston Bridge</i>. One of the
Lieutenant's Men of the Tower being
despatched on special Charge across to
the Bishop of <i>Winchester's</i> Palace, a
Waterman of the Tower Stairs prayed
him for a Cast in his Boat, which he
granted. Seven of <i>Wyat's</i> Men being on
the Look-out, levelled their Arquebusses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
at the Boat, charging them to re-land,
which they not complying with, the
Men discharged their Pieces with mortal
Effect; for the poor Waterman fell dead,
and the Sculler with much Terror rowed
back, through the Bridge, to the Tower
Wharf. The Lieutenant, in a mighty
Heat at what had happened, levelled
seven great Pieces of Ordnance full
against the south End of the Bridge and
against <i>Southwark</i>, besides all the Guns on
the White Tower, and over the Watergate,
so that the Men and Women dwelling
in <i>Southwark</i> rushed confusedly to
Master <i>Wyat</i>, and prayed him to take
Pity on them, or they should be utterly
undone and destroyed. Whereat, he,
partly abashed, said, "I pray you,
Friends, have Patience a little, and
I will presently relieve you of your
Fears." And so, gave Orders to march;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
and cleared out of <i>Southwark</i> about eleven
of the Clock on <i>Shrove Tuesday</i>, without
leaving a Penny unpaid to the Inhabitants,
or doing the least Damage beyond
sacking and destroying the Bishop of
<i>Winchester's</i> Palace and Library. Thus
ended our three Days' Beleaguerment.
Now, leaving the Bridge in sufficient
Guard, Master <i>Hewet's</i> Post lay at one of
the City Gates: and a general Muster in
St. <i>James's Field</i> was proclaimed for Six
o' the Clock next Morning.</p>

<p>At four o' Clock, however, the Drums
called to Arms, <i>Wyat</i> having crossed at
<i>Kingston</i> and being already at <i>Brentford</i>.
The Law-Serjeants went to <i>Westminster
Hall</i>, that Morning, with Harness under
their Gowns, and the Queen's Chaplain
sung Mass before her with Harness under
his Vestments. By ten o' the Clock my
Lord <i>Pembroke's</i> Troop of Horse hovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
about <i>Wyat's</i> Party, and Ordnance began
to be fired on both Sides; whereon the
Screams of Women and peaceable People
at <i>Charing Cross</i>, as well as the Firing,
could be heard at the Tower. <i>Wyat</i>
drove back my <i>Lord Chamberlain's</i> Guard,
and marched on to <i>Ludgate</i> in disorderly
Array. There he knocked at the Gate;
and my Lord <i>Howard</i> from within asked
who knocked: and on his giving his
Name, cried, "Avaunt, Traitor! thou
enterest not here." Sundry of his Men
cried, "Queen <i>Mary</i> hath granted our
Request, and given us Pardon!" but
'twas known for a Feint; so they had
Nought for it but to return whence they
came; and at <i>Charing Cross</i> the Fight
was renewed and waxed hot. At length,
a Herald called on <i>Wyat</i> to yield rather
than shed more Blood, and trust to the
Queen's Mercy. Whereon, he, astonied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
and dejected, replied, "Well, if I must,
let me yield me to a Gentleman." Sir
<i>Morrice Berkeley</i> bade him leap up behind
him; and two others picked up young
<i>Cobham</i> and <i>Knevet</i>, and so carried them
off, and the Fight was ended. They lay,
that Night, in the Tower.</p>

<p>There was Somewhat mighty kindling,
<i>Hew</i>, in that Defence of the Bridge: and
we all felt triumphant and thankful when
the Fight was over; but thereafter came
great Gravity and Sadness, to muse on
what might have been, and on what
would shortly befal those Men in the
Tower. A grievouse Thing is a Civil
War.</p>

<p>Then Master <i>Hewet</i>,&mdash;ah! what a
Shrievalty was his! but yet he thanked
God in After-time that it fell not a Year
or two later&mdash;he must be present at the
beheading the poor guiltless Boy <i>Guilford</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
<i>Dudley</i>, and also of the Lady <i>Jane</i>. That
same Day, <i>Hew</i>, there was set up a Gallows
at every Gate in <i>London</i>, and at
the Bridge-foot; three or four at <i>Charing
Cross</i> and in many other Places. About
four hundred Rebels were condemned in
one Day. The Prisons were so o'er-crowded
that they were kept in Ward
in Churches. The Lady <i>Elizabeth</i> was
committed to the <i>Tower</i>; daily, new
State Prisoners went in, and they that
came forth, 'twas but to their Scaffolds.
<i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Wyat</i>, the <i>Greys</i>&mdash;'twas an awful
Time to be Sheriff! There were City
Feasts; but Men met to look one another
in the Face and ask what would
come next, rather than for Potacion and
Refection.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />&nbsp;<i>Osborne is out of his Time</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I was</span>
out of my Time;
and was examined by the
Master and Wardens of
our Company whether I
had duly and faithfully
served my Apprenticeship: and being
found sufficient and allowed, was presented
to the Chamberlain of <i>London</i> to
be made free; was sworn, and paid Two-and-sixpence.</p>

<p>I remember one of the Wardens eyed
me rather curiously when I went up;
and said, "So thou art young <i>Osborne</i>?"
"Yea," quod the other, "the Knight
of the Flying Leap!" an old Joke I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
thought every one had forgotten. Howbeit
they shook Hands with me, and
said they wished every Master as good
a 'Prentice.</p>

<p>Thereafter I went to see <i>Tomkins</i>, whom
I had lost Sight of a long Time. His
Wife was spreading a clean Diaper over
the Table, his little Girl playing with a
Kitten on the Hearth, and a straggling
Sunbeam through the Lattice was lighting
up his pale, placid Face as he sate at
his Loom. I have thought since, that
ministering Spirits might have been passing
to and fro on that Beam, unperceivable
to my mortal Sense.</p>

<p>"Ha!" quod he, "this is a pleasant
Sight. What! the blue Gown is thrown
off at last! But how? no Scallops?
no Slashes? no Taffeta-lined Cloke,
nor Shirt edged with Silver? Thou
keepest within the Statute, at all Events.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
Why, <i>Miles</i> goes as fine as a Popinjay!
Howbeit, I like your dark brown better
than his Eggs and Spinach; 'tis good
Taste, Lad, not to dress above one's
Degree. All the World can see which
is the Gentleman's Son, which the
Burreller's."</p>

<p>"Thou art e'en too hard on poor
<i>Miles</i>," quod I. "He is working very
hard just now in hope of marrying."</p>

<p>"All the better," saith <i>Tomkins</i>; "many
a second-rate Fellow is made better by
a first-rate Wife. What? is he thinking
of <i>Tryphosa</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," quod I, laughing, "he thinks
her quite too old."</p>

<p>"Look you there now!" quod he,
much amused, "too old, forsooth! To
hear how Boys talk! Marry, you must
sup with us, and tell me about Everything;
that is, if you can condescend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
to eat aught but Manchet-bread in these
grand Days. Step down to <i>Fishmongersrow</i>,
dear <i>Dinah</i>, and fetch us a Crab."</p>

<p>"That's a long Step, <i>Tomkins</i>," observed
his Wife, "would not Something I could
get nearer do as well?"</p>

<p>"No," quod he gently, "I want a
Crab, and I want it from thence; so
oblige me, good <i>Dinah</i>."</p>

<p>"That I will," replied she, cheerfully,
tying on her Hood, and departing the
next Minute with her Child in her
Arms.</p>

<p>"I remember," quod <i>Tomkins</i>, laughing,
"how you and <i>Miles</i> played away at
the Crab on our Wedding-day. And if
you spurn such homely Dainties now,
you'll be Home in Time for your real
Supper after all. 'Tis but Three o' the
Clock."</p>

<p>"To hear you Talk," said I, "one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
would think we lived just now in <i>Lubberland</i>,
where the Rivers run Gravy
and Apple-sauce, and the roast Pigs run
about, saying, Come eat me."</p>

<p>"Why, is not Master <i>Hewet</i> Sheriff?"
quod <i>Tomkins</i>, "and doth he not ride a
gray Horse and wear a velvet Coat and
a Jewel in his Cap? Sure, you must
be steeped in Wassail and Feasting."</p>

<p>"Ah," quod I, "there's little real
Mirth in it. Seldom do we see a
Smile now on Master <i>Hewet's</i> Face ...
Mistress <i>Anne</i> is in the Country; Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> does the Honours with all
Grace, many People come and go, new
Servants wait, many fine Dishes are
cooked and eaten; but the Times are
so bad, there is little Hilarity with
it all."</p>

<p>"Aye?" quod he, lowering his Voice,
"is't e'en so?" Then changing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
Manner altogether, he rose, sate by the
Fire, and pointed me to a Seat over-against
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Ned</i>," saith he, "what is to be looked
for, when the very Heavens above,
though without articulate Voice or
Sound, proclaim coming Judgment?
Two Suns shining at once i' the Firmament!
The Bow of Mercy, not
indeed withdrawn, but <i>reversed</i>; the
Bow turned downward and the two
Ends standing upward! Didst see
it?"</p>

<p>I said, I did; it had puzzled the Wise
and affrighted the Weak.</p>

<p>"Well might it do either or both,"
quod he. "Well! ... we shall see
what comes of it. These Foreshadows
are sometimes sent in Mercy, that
thoughtful People may prepare. 'Fearful
Sights and great Signs shall there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
be from Heaven.' 'And when these
Things begin to come to pass, lift up
your Heads, for your Redemption
draweth nigh.' 'And he that endureth
unto the End, the same shall be saved.'
'Settle it therefore in your Hearts not
to meditate beforehand what ye shall
answer; for <i>I</i> will give you a Mouth
and Wisdom that all your Adversaries
shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.'
'In your patience possess ye your
Souls.'"</p>

<p>"<i>Tomkins!</i>" cried I, filled with sudden
Admiration, "thou couldst not always
have thus quoted and applied the
Bible!"</p>

<p>"Lad," quod he, "Times are altered.
I don't suppose there was ever a quiet,
fair-spoken Man nearer the Edge of
the Pit of Destruction than I was, a
few Years back. Just as I was trifling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
on the Brink, <i>a Child's</i> Voice called
me back. <i>Ned!</i> 'twas thine. I had
known, for Months and Years, what
'twas to lie down with a Heart ill at
Peace with <span class="smcap">God</span>. He that is very glad
to get into a good and safe Covert, will
not waste his Time in dallying with
too curious Subtleties. Since I have
gone the Way I should, Years have
seemed like Days! I have tasted the
<i>Life of Life</i>: yet never was more ready
to lay it down at my Master's Feet!
'Tis all I have to give him!"</p>

<p>"I hope," said I, after a Pause, "there
will be no Need."</p>

<p>"But what have we to expect?" quod
he. "Here's the Mass and all its Mummery
revived on every Hand, Mass
Priests set in the Place of godly
Preachers, and good Men deprived and
cast into Prison. <i>Philip</i> of <i>Spain</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
Cardinal <i>Pole</i> will presently sweep all
before them, and make a clear House
on 't! Do you remember&mdash;but, peradventure
'twas before thy Time&mdash;Master
<i>Chester</i> coming to Master <i>Hewet</i>,
and putting it to him what he should
do with a 'Prentice Lad of his, one
<i>Lawrence Saunders</i>, whom he had overheard
hard wrestling in Prayer, and
found wholly given to spiritual Contemplation
and the reading of godly
Books? Master <i>Hewet</i> advised his
cancelling his Indentures and sending
him to <i>Cambridge</i>, which he did; and
the good Youth did no small Credit to
his kind and enlightened Master. But,
last <i>October</i>, <i>Ned</i>, he preached a Sermon
in <i>All-hallows'</i> Church, the pure Doctrine
whereof brought him into Trouble;
for <i>Bonner</i> and the Chancellor called
him a frenzy Fool and committed him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
to Prison, where he hath lain, in great
hardness, ever since; nor will come
forth, I fear me, except to be burned.
Then there's good Bishop <i>Hooper</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, "when he was committed
to the <i>Fleet</i> last <i>September</i>, he
had nothing for his Bed but a little Pad
of Straw and a rotten Covering, with
a Tick and a few Feathers therein, in
a foul and unwholesome Chamber.
And this we had from his Man <i>John
Downton</i>, Brother to our Maid <i>Damaris</i>;
whereon Master <i>Hewet</i> sent him Money
and a good Bed."</p>

<p>"Then there's young <i>Hunter</i> the 'Prentice,"
continued <i>Tomkins</i>, "was brought
up for refusing to receive the Mass
Communion this Easter. His Master
contrived to send him down to his
Father's at <i>Brentwood</i>, where he presently
fell again into Trouble for reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
of the Bible that lay on the Clerk's
Desk, and was set in the Stocks twenty-four
Hours. And then they sent him
up to <i>Bonner</i>, who set him in the Stocks
at his own Gate for two Days and two
Nights, with only a Crust of Bread
and a Cup of Water; the Lad's young
Brother all the while sitting by him.
Then he was cast into the Convict
Prison, as heavily ironed as one of
his tender Years could bear, and hath
lain there ever since, with a Halfpenny
a Day for his Keep. Could
you or I shew such Constancy, think
you?"</p>

<p>"You might, but I could not,"
said I.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> might, but <i>I</i> might not,"
sighed he&mdash;"not the Thing that will
follow."</p>

<p>And, suddenly thrusting his Hand into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
the very midst of the Fire, which was
burning fiercely, he as suddenly plucked
it out; turning on me a Look I shall
never forget! It expressed the Anguish
of a Man weighed in the Balance and
found wanting. We sate for a few
Seconds in perfect and most painful
Silence; his Hand, in great Blisters,
resting on his Knee. Suddenly I started
up and laid my Hand on his Shoulder.</p>

<p>"<i>Tomkins</i>," cried I, "what are you
thinking of?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking," returned he with
filling Eyes, "how unworthy I was of
the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> that died for me."</p>

<p>"But your Hand! did not you feel
the Smart?"</p>

<p>"My <i>Hand</i>?" cried he, starting and
looking down upon it. "<i>No, not just
then!</i> I'd forgotten it."</p>

<p>"See! see!" cried I, "what may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
the Victory of the Spirit over the
Flesh! What has been, may be
again. As our Day, our Strength
shall be."</p>

<p>The large Tears came into his Eyes.
"<i>Ned</i>," quod he, "I will never doubt
it again."</p>

<p>"And now," said I, "let me dress
your Hand, for I know Something
of Burns." So I went out and got
white Cotton Wool, and wrapped a great
Pad of it about his Hand, and tied it up
neatly; and, just at that Time, his Wife
came in with the Crab.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the Matter?" cried she,
changing Colour.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, my Love," returned
her Husband cheerfully, "save that I've
burnt my Hand."</p>

<p>"Ah," said she, "you wist the Handle
of the Kettle was loose.... I won't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
pity you at all! <i>Is</i> it a very bad Hurt,
though?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to speak of," quod he.</p>

<p>"Forsooth, and you couldn't smile so,
an' 'twere&mdash;only thou hast made such a
great Bundle of it. Shall I tie it up
neater for thee, Husband?"</p>

<p>"No, sweet Heart, it does well enough.
So now for the Crab.... And so
young Mistress <i>Anne</i> is in the Country?"</p>

<p>"At the Hall," quod I, "with her
Uncle."</p>

<p>"Ah," sayth he quietly, "the Squire
hath two fair Sons ... I think she
will settle down there one of these
Days."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />&nbsp;<i>Evil Times bring Evil Crimes</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I love</span>
not to think of
that Year: still less of
those which followed
after it! In <i>July</i>, <i>Philip</i>
of <i>Spain</i> landed on our
Shores, and as he placed his Foot for the
first Time on <i>British</i> Ground, he drew his
Sword, and carried it a little Way naked
in his Hand; which, if it meant Anything,
certes did mean no Good. The
Mayor of <i>Southampton</i> brought him the
Keys of the Town, which he took and
gave back without the least Token of
Good-will or Civility for the Respect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
Five Days thereafter, his Marriage with
the Queen was solemnized at <i>Winchester</i>,
he being seven and twenty, and she eight
and thirty; and thereon they were together
proclaimed as King and Queen of
<i>England</i>. An Evil Song to <i>English</i> Ears!
But oh! the Shews and Pageants that
were got up to welcome them in <i>London</i>!
Giants, offering Addresses; our Condyts
running Wine; and what not?</p>

<p>Thereafter, the Queen and her King
behoved to go to <i>Hampton Court</i>; where,
I will just observe, the Hall-door was
continually kept shut, so as no Man
might enter, unless his Errand were first
known; which might perhaps be the
Fashion in <i>Spain</i>, but to plain, honest
<i>Englishmen</i>, seemed very strange.</p>

<p>About this Time there were so many
<i>Spaniards</i> in <i>London</i>, that for one <i>Englishman</i>
in the Stretes thou mightest meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
four <i>Spaniards</i>, with their long, sly Slits of
Eyes, and hairy Faces; so that it behoved
<i>us</i> to keep our Hall-doors shut and look
to our Spoons, for I never heard the King
Consort undertook to stand Bail for them.
About <i>September</i> they went their Ways;
not entirely paying their Bills.</p>

<p>About this Time, the Disaffection of
the Body Politic was betrayed by a small
Rising in <i>Suffolk</i>, soon put down. Howbeit,
it gave Occasion for a Talk of twelve
thousand <i>Spaniards</i> coming over to strengthen
the Crown. Also, from the Queen's
common Ordinary of her Household was
struck off twenty-two Messes of Meat;
which was considered to be paring the
Cheese rather close.</p>

<p>Also, the new Coins were issued: them
that we call the Double-face. The
<i>Spanish</i> Prince, to buy good Opinion, had
brought over Heaps of Gold with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
In one Day, there came to the Tower
twenty Carts guarded by <i>Spaniards</i>, each
containing twenty-seven Chests of Treasure,
matted about with Mats. But Gold
won't buy Love: the common Talk was
how he held himself close, and lived
sullen, without ever an <i>English</i> Lord at
Court save only the Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>.</p>

<p>Then Bishop <i>Bonner</i> began his Visitation,
to see the old Service set up, and
paint out the Scripture Texts on the
Church-walls, and set up the Images.
They say that, in conducting this Matter,
he was little short of a raging Madman,
whenever he met with any, the least
Opposition.... I think thou mayst
believe it of him, when thou hearest
what I have presently to say.</p>

<p>Master <i>Hewet's</i> Shrievalty was out; and
never was Man better pleased to slip his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
Neck out of the Collar. We were sitting
peaceably together, when a Woman comes
in to him all in Tears. 'Twas <i>Tomkins'</i>
Wife, poor <i>Dinah</i>, to do us to wit that
<i>Tomkins</i>, with sundry others, had been
apprehended by Bishop <i>Bonner</i>, and taken
for Examination to his Palace at <i>Fulham</i>.
"And, unless their Manhood fail them,"
quo' she, weeping, "we may give them
up for lost; for he makes the Real
Presence a Net for catching Small and
Great." We comforted her all we
could; but she spake too true a Word.</p>

<p>The Constancy of this poor Weaver,
<i>Hew</i>, shewn under Examination, was very
notable. There were six Prisoners in all;
but <i>Tomkins</i>, perhaps on Account of his
being the elder of them, was brought
most forward. To intimidate these poor
Men the more, Bishop <i>Bonner</i> had got
together a goodly Muster of his Clergy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
and Friends, Dr. <i>Chedsey</i>, Master <i>Harpsfield</i>,
and others. Beginning the Attack,
according to his Wont, with the Real
Presence, he put it to <i>Tomkins</i> whether
or no he believed in Transubstantiation.
On <i>Tomkins'</i> meekly but firmly confessing
he did not, and giving his Reasons for
that Confession, <i>Bonner</i> struck him on
the Face with his Fist, and violently tore
out a Handful of his Beard. <i>Tomkins</i>
bare this in Silence, remembering Him
who stood before <i>Caiaphas</i>. Then <i>Bonner</i>,
lashing himself up, began anew to question
him; and being still unable to catch
him in his Talk, he seized him by the
Wrist; and holding his Hand over a
lighted Candle of three or four Wicks
that stood on the Table, savagely kept it
there till the Veins shrank and the Sinews
burst.</p>

<p>"But, <i>Ned</i>," quoth this meek Martyr,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
telling me of it in <i>Newgate</i>, "though one
of the Bishop's own Friends that stood
by turned so sick that he cried, 'Hold!
enough!' I affirm unto you that I was
so rapt, and in such immediate Communion
with my <span class="smcap">God</span> and <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>,
that, <i>at that Time</i>, I felt or was sensible
of no Pain! I say not I felt none
afterwards: I feel it now. But ne'er-theless,
I tell thee, <i>Ned</i>, I am ready not
only to suffer this, but also to die for
the Name of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, if it be
his Will."</p>

<p>And many other such godly and comfortable
Words he spake, both then and
during the next six Months; for I was
continually with him. And, during all
that Time, his Courage never waxed faint,
but he bare that long Probation and Suspense
patiently and cheerfully; never
rising into Rapture, but full of Love and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
Hope; and grateful exceedingly unto
Master <i>Hewet</i>, for keeping his Wife and
Child in Bread all that Time.</p>

<p>Then saw I, how diverse, yea, how inferior
is that Sort of instinctive animal
Courage which made me leap from
<i>London Bridge</i>, from that moral Courage
which enableth a Man kept low, and
contumeliously treated, to support, by
the Space of half an Year, the Prospect
of a cruel and lingering Death.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah, Boy, thou mayest say what
thou listest:&mdash;thou art a young Soldier.&mdash;Besides,
thou hast <i>both</i> Sorts; one,
maybe, from me; and one from <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>And now, to crown all, came over
Cardinal <i>Pole</i>, whom our <i>Spanish</i> King
came down to the Water-side to meet,
so soon as he had learned he had shot
the Bridge. But in Faith, <i>Hew</i>, he was
not so evil as the others. He was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
longer the Man for whom Queens might
die in Love; still less the Youth that
had bandied Jests with <i>More</i> and <i>Erasmus</i>:&mdash;he
had known Sorrow, I wot!&mdash;his
Mother, his Brother, his Cousin, had
been brought with Sorrow to their Graves;
and albeit his Friends did say of him he
should be called <i>non Polus Anglus, sed
Polus angelus</i>, he carried his Sadness in
his Face.</p>

<p>And now, the Church and Realm of
<i>England</i> were proclaimed reconciled to
the Pope of <i>Rome</i>, the slavish Parliament
put its Neck under the Queen's Foot,
there was great singing of <i>Te Deum</i>, and
great kindling of Bone-fires;&mdash;Alas! there
were to be other Bone-fires soon.</p>

<p>The New Year opened ominously.
About thirty Citizens, Men and Women,
privately receiving the Communion of
Mr. <i>Rose</i>, their Minister, in a House in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
<i>Bow Churchyard</i>, were haled to Prison.
For thou seest, <i>Hew</i>, Romanism had now,
through the Slavishness of our Parliament,
been re-established as <i>the Law of
the Land</i>, which all Friends of good
Order were bounden to uphold; wherefore
those were constrained to break it
and be classed as bad Citizens who chose
rather to abide by <i>the Law of</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;a
Dilemma that ought never to have happened.
They that are set in foremost
Places are bounden to stand in the Breach,
that Evil ensew not unto them whose
Place is behind them.</p>

<p>Now, see in what a Strait was Master
<i>Hewet</i>. He and every other Alderman
had to attend <i>Paul's</i> Church on <i>Paul's</i>
Day, where the King and Cardinal came
in great State, to give Thanks for the
Re-conversion of the Realm to the Roman
Catholic Church. This was on the 25<i>th</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
and on the 28<i>th</i>, the Bishops had Commission
from the Cardinal to try all such
Preachers and Heretics as lay in Prison.
By Virtue whereof, <i>Gardiner</i> and the other
Bishops had up before them that very
Day, Bishop <i>Hooper</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Rogers</span>, Mr.
<i>Cardmaker</i>, and others, in the Church of
St. <i>Mary Overy</i>. I stood, with others, at
the Church Door, to see the Prisoners
come out. They were remanded to the
Compter in <i>Southwark</i> about four o' the
Clock, just as 'twas growing dark, till
nine the next Morning; and as they came
forth, I saw good Bishop <i>Hooper</i> look
back and wait a little for Master <i>Rogers</i>,
whom, when he came up, he cheerfully
addressed with, "Come, Brother <i>Rogers</i>,
must we two take this Matter first in
Hand, and begin to fry these Fagots?"
"By <span class="smcap">God's</span> Grace, Sir," quod <i>Rogers</i>, "we
will." "Doubt not," returns the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
Bishop, "but <span class="smcap">God</span> will give us that."
And so passed on, Hand in Hand,
much cheered and pressed on by the
People.</p>

<p>Next Day, they were re-examined and
condemned and degraded. The Sheriffs
had much ado to guard them to the <i>Clink</i>
in <i>Southwark</i>, where they kept them in
Ward till Dark, hoping the Throng would
disperse or ere they brought them across
the Bridge to <i>Newgate</i>. Howbeit, about
eight o' the Clock, I being alone and
busied, heard a great Rumour, followed
by sharp, shrill Cries along the Bridge,
and Master <i>Hewet</i>, stepping in, all in
a Heat, sayth, "Lights! Lights!" I
mutely gave him mine, and fetched
another, and we stood at the Door, protecting
the Candles from the Wind with
our Hands. Others were hastily bringing
Candles to their Doors; and still we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
could hear Men and 'Prentices running
forward and crying "Lights!"</p>

<p>"They thought to do a Deed of Darkness
in the dark," quod Master <i>Hewet</i>,
wiping his Brow, "and to smuggle them
across to <i>Newgate</i> under cover of the
Night; and so sent forward to have
all the Candles at the Costermongers'
Stalls extinguished ... but, if they're
ashamed of their Work, let them
abye it!... <span class="smcap">God</span> speed you, Master
<i>Hooper</i>! <span class="smcap">God</span> save you, Master <i>Rogers</i>!
The Blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span> be on you and on
all like you!"</p>

<p>"The same to you all, dear Friends!"
responded the cheerful Voice of the good
Bishop as he passed. "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> have
you all evermore in his keeping."</p>

<p>And then Master <i>Hewet</i> went in and
covered his Face and wept.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I may</span>
as well tell thee
now, <i>Hew</i>, by way of
Relief to heavier Matters,
the ludicrous Form that
<i>Miles's</i> Protestantism took.
He was never one of the most serious;
and when Master <i>Hewet</i>, at the preceding
Easter, had, on Compulsion as Alderman
of the Ward, given formal Notice to
every Householder, with their Families,
to prepare to confess and receive the Sacrament,
<i>Miles</i> sayth with a knavish Look
at me, "I must do Somewhat first, to
confess about."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
Presently after that I heard him coaxing
Mistress <i>Fraunces's</i> white Cat with,
"Pussy, Pussy, Pussy! come to Preferment,
Pussy!" But Puss, as if she
smelt Mischief in the Wind, flew up the
Chimney. Then quod he, "Thou'rt too
good for the Purpose, after all. I must
go pay my Duty to the Sub-prioress
that lives all alone with her Cats."
Quod I, "What Mischief are you about
now?" Saith he, "If you ask no unpleasant
Questions, you'll hear no unpleasant
Answers. What if I want to
get up a little Masque of Puss in
Boots?"</p>

<p>Next Day, at dawning, there was seen
in <i>Chepe</i>, on the Gallows that had been
set up for the <i>Kentish</i> Rioters, a Cat suspended,
apparelled like a Priest ready to
say Mass, with a shaven Crown, and her
two forefeet tied over her Head, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
round Paper like a Wafer-cake put between
them, as though in the Act of
raising the Host. Fits of boisterous
Laughter rang through <i>Chepe</i>: howbeit,
the Queen and Bishops were in great
Dudgeon; and a Proclamation was made,
that same Afternoon, that whosoever
should bring forth the guilty Party should
have twenty Nobles, which was afterwards
increased to twenty Marks: but I
need not say that nobody ever claimed it.
I think I might have put the Money in
my Pocket if I would.</p>

<p>Howbeit, neither <i>Miles</i> nor I felt ourselves
called upon to confess to the Priest;
in special as Master <i>Hewet</i> never enforced
it on any, after the first formal Notice:
and I wot, he went not himself. Indeed,
it was marvellous, he said in after Years,
that considering how open he laid himself
to Animadversion on these Matters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
no Enemy took Advantage of him; howbeit,
I doubt if he had one; there were
many to make common Cause with him,
and he was much loved throughout the
Ward.</p>

<p>But I have not done with <i>Miles</i> yet.
The next Offence his Protestantism took
was at an Idol of <i>Thomas à Becket</i>, which
the <i>Lord Chancellor</i> caused to be set up
over the Mercers' Chapel Door, in <i>Chepe</i>:
which, within two Days, had its Head
lopped off in the Night. Upon this rose
great Disturbance, and one Mr. <i>Barnes</i>, a
Mercer, who lived over-against the Chapel,
was vehemently accused by my Lord
<i>Wriothesley</i> of being Principal or Accessary
to the Deed. He defended himself with
every Semblance of Innocence; nevertheless,
he and three 'Prentices were imprisoned
for a Day or two; and, though
Nothing was proven against him, he was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
on his Delivery, bound in a great Sum of
Money to repair the Image so often as it
should be broken down, and also to watch
and defend the same. I should never
have suspected <i>Miles</i> of having had Aught
to do with this Matter, save for his
gloomy and guilty Looks while <i>Barnes</i>
lay in Ward, and for his great Access of
Gaiety when he was let forth. Howbeit,
there are some People whose absolute
Genius and Destiny seems to be Mischief;
and, a Day or two after the Image's
Restoration, I heard <i>Miles</i>, after pacing
up and down the Chamber awhile like a
chafed Lion in a Cage, exclaim in a Sort
of Desperation, "I must do it again!"
And next Day, the <i>second</i> Head was
missing. This Time, a hundred Crowns
of Gold were offered for Discovery of the
Culprit. But they never were claimed.
Then quod <i>Miles</i>, embracing me with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
unwonted Ardour of Affection, "Ned!
thou'rt a capital Fellow!"</p>

<p>Howbeit, <i>Miles</i> presently became absorbed
in his Love-affair, which brought
his protestant Zeal to a very ignoble
Termination. He now lodged at some
Distance from us, and kept his private
Concerns very much to himself. Having
one Day Occasion to speak to him at his
Lodging, I there found not only his
Mother, but an exceeding pretty young
Woman. "<i>Ned!</i>" quod he, "this is my
Wife; I forgot to tell you before, that
I was married!" "I've a great Mind
to forget it too!" sayth she, pouting,
as I went up to salute her, "the Saints
be my Witness!" at which, I looked
attentively at her and then at him.</p>

<p>He followed me to the Door when
mine Errand was sped. "<i>Ned</i>," whispered
he, and coloured all over, "there'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
be no more hanging of Cats!...
She's a staunch <i>Roman</i>, is <i>Nell</i>! and
I'm obliged to conform, I can tell
thee! Rely on't, there's much to be
said upon both Sides!" And this was
he, had said he was as firm as <i>London
Stone</i>.</p>

<p>I shook my Head at him, but was not,
just then, going to attempt his Conversion.
By way of confirming myself in
the Faith, I passed on to <i>Newgate</i>, where
I saw <i>Tomkins</i>, young <i>Hunter</i>, and their
Fellow-prisoner in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, Master
<i>Rogers</i>, who was to suffer the next
Morning. To hear him talk, one would
have thought he saw Heaven opened, and
the bright Vision that St. <i>Stephen</i> had,
revealed to his inward Eye; and he
mightily strengthened his Brethren. His
Wife being denied Access to him, he
prayed me give her a Kerchief, the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
poor Token he had to send; and to bid
her, if she had Strength for 't, to be
by the Wayside with the Children, next
Morn, on the Way to <i>Smithfield</i>. I took
her there myself; the poor Soul was
wondrously supported; and when the
good Man came by, I held one of his
little Children towards him, prompting
him to say, "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will strengthen
thee, Father!" Which, indeed, he
did.</p>

<p>Well, after the Euthanasy of this
blessed Proto-martyr, who, as though to
confirm the Courage of those that came
after, did literally wash his Hands in the
Flame as if he felt no Smart, <i>Tomkins'</i>
Courage, strange to say, greatly departed
from him, and he doubted much if he
should hold firm unto the End. Thereon,
great Prayer was made for him by his
Brethren in Bonds, and, I am bold to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
at one or two solitary Bed-sides: and
it came to pass, at all Events, that he
was strengthened to go through his next
Examination, with young <i>Hunter</i> and the
Rest, in <i>Paul's</i> Consistory, five Days after
<i>Rogers</i> was burned. The Lad <i>Hunter</i>,
who stood by his Brother to the Last,
heard all five Prisoners condemned to die
by <i>Bonner</i>.</p>

<p>Thereon Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> and I went,
under Shadow of Evening, to <i>Tomkins'</i>
Wife. She was in strong Fits, with
sundry poor Women about her; and,
leaving Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> to add to their
tender Ministrations, I went on to <i>Newgate</i>,
if haply Master <i>Hewet's</i> Name might
still serve me to have Access to my poor
Friend. Directly I saw him I knew, by
the mild steady Light in his Eye, that
his Courage was safe! "<i>Ned</i>," quod he,
"I was given over a little While unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
Darkness, just to let me feel that the
Strength within me was none of mine;
but now, my Friend hath come back
to me, and I rejoice in his Light!
Soon we shall be eternally together;
and oh! how much we shall have to
tell and to hear. Little will it matter,
then, whether my Ashes were scattered
to the four Winds, or collected in a
stone Jug like a <i>Roman's</i>. Direct poor
<i>Dinah</i> to the seventy-seventh Psalm; I
know it will comfort her. Dear Master
<i>Hewet</i> will keep her from Want; and
she will presently retire to her Friends
in the Country. So, thou seest, I have
no Fear for Temporalities! Look! she
hath made me this long white Shirt to
wear to-morrow; my Wedding-garment,
I call it. Tell her every Stitch she set
in it evidenced her Faith, as every Blow
wherewith <i>Abraham</i> clave the Fagots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
whereon to offer his Son, proved his.
And a lighter Sacrifice is exacted of her,
for she hath not to slay me, only to resign
me. And now, good speed, good <i>Ned</i>....
Don't be at <i>Smithfield</i> to-morrow,
only stand by the Way as I go along
... thou hast risked too much for me
already."</p>

<p>In Sooth I ne'er thought twice of the
Risk; but I doubted whether what he
could bear to <i>feel</i>, I could bear to <i>see</i>. I
stood over-against the Door as he came
forth; our Eyes met; and in a Tone
that had Somewhat of Musicalness in it
that searched and sank into the very
Heart, he sayth, "The Night is far spent,
Lad! the Day is at Hand!"</p>

<p>Those Token-words drew me irresistibly
after him. I felt no Fear, no
Horror just then; only that our two
Souls clave together, and that mine must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
keep near his till 'twas caught up. So I
kept a little in advance, and eyed him
now and then, that he might just see I
stood by him; and I think it gave him
Pleasure, for I once heard him say, "The
Presence of a Friend, that cleaveth to
us unto Death, how good is it!"</p>

<p>But Martyrs were forbidden to make
long Speeches on Pain of having their
Tongues cut out; and indeed, their Constancy
preached enow. Wherefore this
was the last Word I heard from his Lips,
for he seemed entirely addressing himself
to another Friend whom we could neither
hear nor see. And, when he got to the
Place, I saw him put his Arms affectionately
about the Stake and kiss it, (they
all did that,) and then lay aside his poor
Weaver's Garments, prison-worn and tattered,
and put on what seemed indeed
the white Robe of Immortality, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
stand firm while they put the Chain about
his Waist. Just then a Man pushed
rudely past me with a Fagot; and there
was a Rush and a Press of New-comers
that jostled me from my Place and wanted
to feed their greedy Appetites with a
good Man's Pain as if 'twere a mere
Show. I pushed at them again, and
struggled forward, amid Blows and reviling,
and gat Sight of a Puff of Smoke,
and a bright Flame leaping up. Just
then, the Sun, breaking forth from a
stormy Cloud, shone full upon his Face,
which, looking upward with a joyous
Smile, seemed transfigured by it. I could
see no more ... mine Eyes were blinded,
my Throat choked. I pushed my Way
through the Crowd and went Home to
pray for&mdash;myself, not for him!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />&nbsp;<i>A Snake among y<sup>e</sup> Flowers</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">I can</span>
give thee, <i>Hew</i>, no
very connected Account of
the Rest of that Season....
One Horror followed
another&mdash;the Land was
full of Blood, and Fire, and Vapour of
Smoke. We went softly, and lived
gloomy, and wretched, and desolate.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wished my Turn would
come: then, dreaded it. <i>Tomkins</i> was
continually before mine Eyes. At last,
I suppose I altered so, that Master <i>Hewet</i>
sent me down to my Mother, to keep
quiet awhile in the Country.</p>

<p>Oh! what Happiness that was! The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
Tears we then shed together had Healing
in them; and soon, away from all hateful
Sounds and Sights, we gave over weeping
altogether. My Mother, I found, had, in
the first Instance, outwardly conformed;
<i>kissed Baal</i>, in Fact; and then, like a good
many other timid yet well-meaning Persons,
found many Excuses to make for
having so done, which yet failed to allay
Self-disapprobation, and ended in Contrition
and Resolutions of doing so no more.
She was favourably placed for the keeping
of such Resolves; having moved out of
<i>Ashford</i>, to a remote Country-farm, too
far from a Place of Worship for regular
Attendance, wherefore she had set a-foot
a little Church within her House, that
was served, under the Rose, by a deprived
Minister harbouring in the Neighbourhood.
One of my younger Brothers, a
goodly Lad, was at School; the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
a sickly Urchin, dwelt at Home, inactive
but very happy.</p>

<p>So here I tarried, Thanks to good
Master <i>Hewet</i>! till my Mind quite regained
its Strength, as happy as a Rook
on <i>Sundays</i>, as we say in <i>Kent</i>. The
Change was so great, that my Absence
seemed much longer than it really was.
On my Return to <i>London</i>, as I rode along
<i>Kentstrete</i>, my Heart seemed to fly forward
to what, in Course of Years, had become
my very Home. And, when we were all
re-united beneath the same Roof, and I
had fallen into my old Course, with very
little Interference with the World without,
I shortly began to be ware of a deep,
new, inward Source of Happiness, that
for a While I neither could nor would
understand. Whatever I did, wherever
I went, the very Air I breathed seemed
to have a Glow, and Sweetness, and Freshness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
in it, whether my Errand led me
through the Skinners' Yards in <i>Budgerow</i>,
or the Butchers' Stalls in <i>Eastchepe</i>; 'twas
all the same!&mdash;let the Stretes be ringing
with Noises, there was a Song of Angels
in my Head that made me deaf thereunto.
And soon I was ware that this
new Sweetness of Living, which was
Serenity abroad, was Rapture at Home;
and so all-satisfying was it, that I took no
Care for the Morrow, nor aspired for
Aught I had not, but only coveted to go
on just as I was.</p>

<p>Master <i>Hewet</i>, about this Time, was
full content with me, and reposed in me
more and more Trust. Whereby I became
aware that his Ventures were
becoming more important, his Connexions
more extended, his Credit higher,
his Gains greater; and yet, withal, no
Abatement of his old Rule of Simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
and Plainness; unless with regard to
Mistress <i>Anne</i>. No Money was in Sooth
spared on her for Teaching or Dressing:
her Chambers for Night and Day had, I
believe, every Adornment that Money and
Taste could procure: if her Ornaments
were few, it was rather that she did not
affect wearing many, than that there was
Anything her Eye coveted that her Father
would not buy for her. But she was one
whom Indulgence could not spoil. Her
Money, of which she had ample Allowance
from an early Age, (it being one of
Master <i>Hewet's</i> sage Maxims, that Children
should be irresponsible Controulers
of some regular Stipend, however small,
to teach them Self-denial, Liberality, and
Charity,) her Money, I say, was freely
expended upon others, and employed in
gratifying many an innocent Taste for
Flowers, Birds, and such-like. Thus it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
fell, that I was now and then made Party
to some little Mystery that gave me
Pleasure she wist not she was bestowing,
for I am persuaded she was at this Time
living chiefly in a little Dream-land of
her own, peopled with none but good
Spirits and fair Prospects. It was, "<i>Osborne</i>,
dost thou care to favour me so
much as to step down to the <i>Blanche
Chapelton</i>, and slip this into the Hand of
the poor Basket-maker whose House
was burned down last Night?"&mdash;or,
<i>Edward</i>, I want to buy my Father an
Inkstand I have seen in <i>Lyme-strete</i>;
'tis of rare Fancy, and, I think, a real
Antique&mdash;a Hare in her Form, made
of some glossy, brown Substance; and
between the Hare's Ears is the Mouth
of the Inkstand.&mdash;The Shop looks not
like one I should care to enter, but 'tis
over-against the Green-gate of <i>Miguel</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
<i>Pistoy</i>. Mind not the Price, but see
thou tell not even <i>Damaris</i>."</p>

<p>Now, though Master <i>Hewet</i> so liberally
supplied her Privy-purse, there were certain
Household Expenses he made her
reckon to a Penny; and, if she were at
Fault, she had to make it good. 'Twas
pretty, and diverting, to hear these two
sometimes arguing together over their
Account-book: for Mistress <i>Anne</i> was not
a ready Reckoner, and he would by no
Means be put off with a Quip. One
Day, they were counting out their Money,
when he said, "<i>Ned</i>, this young Gentlewoman
can never attain to a competent
Knowledge of Figures. I'll give thee a
Couple of Angels to carry her on into
Practice, for I shall save Money i' the
End."</p>

<p>So when he is gone, I say, "Come,
Mistress, the Bribe is very high ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
where shall we begin? I suppose 'twill
shame you to be put too far back."</p>

<p>"I hardly know what will be too far
back," saith she, rogueing a little&mdash;"My
Father sayeth I have done this
wrong&mdash;" and she gives me a little
Slip of Paper, inscribed with the neatest,
prettiest little Figures.</p>

<p>"Good now!" said I, "the only Mistake
herein is,&mdash;you have essayed to
subtract the greater Number from the
less; which you know can never be."</p>

<p>"Yes, it can be, sometimes," saith she,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Never!" say I. "How?"</p>

<p>"Take <span class="smcap">V</span> from <span class="smcap">IV</span> and <span class="smcap">I</span> remains!"
quod she. So I laughed, and told
her many a Spendthrift would like that
Reckoning.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I suppose you desire
not to begin with Enumeration."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
"Since your Time is so valuable,"
sayth she, "you need not teach me at
all."</p>

<p>"Nay, Mistress," say I, "count a
Million if you will! I can tarry."</p>

<p>"How long will that take me?" quod
she.</p>

<p>"Why," say I, "if you count a Hundred
a Minute, that is, six Thousand
in an Hour, and count at that Rate
for fourteen Hours in the twenty-four,
you may in twelve Days count
a Million."</p>

<p>"Hold, hold!" cries she, "you will
make me puzzle-headed for a week!"
and so, runs off.</p>

<p>Next Time I saw her alone, I say,
"Well, Mistress, are you in the Humour
for Practice?"</p>

<p>"No," quoth she with Decision, "I
know Figures already!" And commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
tinkling on her Virginals. So,
there an End ... or might ha' been,
were any Woman two Days o' the same
Mind. But, shortly, she cometh to me
with a Tear in her Eye.</p>

<p>"<i>Ned</i>," saith she, "what's to be done?
I gave all the Money in my Purse (there
wasn't much), to the Girdler's Widow,
hard by St. <i>Anne</i> in the Willows; and
now, I can't make up my Father's
Accounts, and shall seem unto him a
Defaulter."</p>

<p>"Or be one ... which?" quod I.
"What is to do?"</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> I do?" returns she.</p>

<p>"Marry," say I, "I can lend you the
Money."</p>

<p>"Nay," quoth she quickly, "it would
not be right in me to take it."</p>

<p>"You have Reason," say I. "It would
not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
"Then what remaineth?" she said.</p>

<p>"Honesty afore Charity," I made
Answer. "You must ask Master <i>Hewet</i>
to deduct it from your next Quarterage,
and henceforth give not away his
Money when you have spent your
own."</p>

<p>"He would never have grutched it!"
cries she, kindling.</p>

<p>"Forsooth, then, all's said," quod I,
and turned to go.</p>

<p>"<i>Ned!</i> stop," cries she, "how <i>canst</i>
thou be so ill-natured?" and began to
cry a little. "Why did you not, the
other Day, as my Father bade you,
put me on some better Method with
my Accounts?"</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "I was about to try,
when you started off like a young Deer
from a Gad-fly."</p>

<p>"Well," saith she, "run this up for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
me, at all Events, and see if there be
any Error in the Sum-total ... I shall
be grateful to you either Way."</p>

<p>So I began,&mdash;"<i>To Groceries, four-and-fourpence</i>...."</p>

<p>"Four-and-fourpence!" cries she,
"Four Pound four!"</p>

<p>"'Tis here plainly set down," say I,
"as four-and-fourpence."</p>

<p>"Oh, charming!" cries she, "then
all's straight!"</p>

<p>And, catching the Paper from mine
Hand, she goes off with it, and I see no
more of her nor her Accounts.</p>

<p>Only, about a Month after, Master
<i>Hewet</i> says, "Well, <i>Ned</i>, I have not paid
thee thy two Angels?"</p>

<p>"I have not earned them, Sir," I say,
"Mistress <i>Anne</i> will none of my teaching."</p>

<p>"In Faith, then, she has schooled
herself to some Purpose," saith he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
smiling, "for she is ready enough
now, both at Proportion and Practice.
What a whimsical young Lass it is!"</p>

<p>In Fact she had, as about this Time,
that Necessity for Application to practical
Affairs which makes many Women good
Reckoners whether they have a natural
Turn for it or no. For Mistress <i>Fraunces's</i>
Health failing her a little, Mistress <i>Anne</i>
undertook the Conduct of the Household,
which the other as readily yielded unto
her, witting that the Pratique would do
her good. So she went about, demurely,
with the Keys, measuring this and weighing
that, and setting down Everything in
a little Book at her Girdle. 'Twas a
Lesson, to see her Tendance, in all duteous
Affectuousness, on good Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>,
who indeed merited of her the Love of
a Daughter, and whom she soon nursed
well. Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>, always very softhearted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
told me I should find she had
not forgotten my Care of her, in her Will.
Howbeit, I was thankful no Occasion
came of opening it.</p>

<p>On my Birthday, Mistress <i>Anne</i> came to
me smiling, with her Hands behind her,
and said, "Which Hand will you have?"</p>

<p>I regarded her earnestly, and said, "The
right Hand, Mistress."</p>

<p>"Oh, miserable Choice!" cried she,
laughing, and throwing me a worn Glove
of her own; "hadst thou said 'Left,'
thou shouldest have had this brave new
Pair of scented Gloves!"</p>

<p>I said, "I'm content," and took up the
cast Glove with Pleasure.</p>

<p>"Well," sayth she, "you are too indifferent
by half about your Blunder&mdash;howbeit,
here they are for you; I bought
them of Purpose."</p>

<p>So I bowed reverently and took them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
in my Hand; but, when she was gone, I
put the other in my Bosom.</p>

<p>Another Time, I was arranging a Sunshade
for Mistress <i>Fraunces</i>, in the blue-buckram
Chamber, when Mistress <i>Anne</i>
calleth me into the Balcony to look at
some sunset Clouds, which she likened
unto an Oliphant with a Princess on its
Back, and to Armies and Fairy Palaces
and such-like, till I told her if she span
any more of her gold Cobwebs about me,
I should be unable to leave the Balcony.
Without heeding me, she giveth a great
Sigh, and says, "There's one Thing I
should like, that I know my Father
would forbid. Pshaw, <i>Ned!</i> thou needs
not look so surprise-stricken! 'tis but to
have my Fortune told, by a real Fortune-teller."</p>

<p>"And so double your Sorrows and
deaden your Pleasures, Mistress?" say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
I. "Ah, no, 'tis bad tampering with unlawful
Quests."</p>

<p>And then I told her a Tale current in
the Part of the Country I came from,
of a Lady who would dabble in Things
supernal; and how her Fore-knowledge,
actual or phansied, bred in her
such Impatience of her present Lot and
Greediness for Things to come, as to lead
her to poison her Husband. And how
the Grass would ne'er grow over his
Body, but left the exact Outline of it,
Arms, Legs, Feet, Hands, traced out
a-top of his Grave; as may be seen
this Day: and how she, a likely and
well-favoured Woman, finding herself
viewed askance by all, albeit no Crime
could be proven against her, did call on
Heaven to make her as thin as a Willowwand
if she had any hidden Guilt upon
her Soul; and how from that self-same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
Day she peaked and pined, dwindled, and
fell away, till there was no Substance, so
to speak, in her; for a Child might ha'
carried her, she was the Lightness of one
of Mistress <i>Anne's</i> satin Slippers.</p>

<p>At the End of this Tale, Mistress <i>Anne</i>
drew a deep Breath, and, saith she, "<i>Ned</i>,
thou wert always a marvellous Recounter!&mdash;Tell
me another Tale, as
moving as the last." So I told her
another and another; till the Stars began
to come out; and a Singer in a Boat lying
a little Way off began to sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse quote">"What though thine Eyes be like the Sun</div>
  <div class="verse">That lights up all he looks upon&mdash;"</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Whose can those be?" quod she.
"Aye! whose, indeed?" said I. But I
thought I knew.&mdash;Thus, in honeyed
Sweetness, lapsed Day after Day.</p>

<p>But it came to an End. I found at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
last, whether I would shut mine Eyes or
no, whether I would give Ear or feign
Dullness, that I was seeing, hearing Nothing
but Mistress <i>Anne</i>. At first, I
would not attend to this; then said (in
<i>Answer</i> to Something,) "What Harm?"
But yet Something answered back again,
There <i>is</i> Harm. Then quod I, To
whom? There is none, nor never shall
be to any save myself, and the only Harm
to me is the Pain; and if the Pain is a
Pleasure, or I choose to bear it and count
it as such, where's the Harm and where's
the Wrong?</p>

<p>But the Pleasure was gone. At least,
there was so much Pain overlying it, that
it was crushed down and smothered, and
struggling to get free of its Burthen.
Then I asked myself what this was about,
and whither could it tend, and what had
I lost that I had had before, that made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
me seem a different <i>Ned Osborne</i>? Also,
why did I bring Shame on myself and
bring Master <i>Hewet's</i> keen Observance on
me by such and such a Blunder in my
daily Charge? Was his Eye altering
towards me? Would it not needs alter,
did he wit the foolish, impossible Things
I spent the best (the <i>worst</i>) of my Time
in dreaming of? Oh! my Heart would
not bear it! There was Something eating
its Way into my Soul, as a Weevil gnaws
its Way into a Garner.</p>

<p>&mdash;No, this could not go on. I thought
over it and took my Part; and after
watching and letting slip many Opportunities,
I at length, in Desperation, took
the very first that came next, and stood
beside Master <i>Hewet</i> at his Desk when I
wist that no Other was or would soon
be within Earshot; and said, "Master, I
must go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
"Whither, Lad?" quod he, surprised,
yet kindly,&mdash;"On some Errand of thine
own about the Town?"</p>

<p>I tried to get back my Voice, it faltered
so!&mdash;and said, "Away ... away from
here."</p>

<p>"Art ill?" quod he, laying down his
Pen, and suddenly looking full at me.
"Dost thou want to go for a While into
the Country?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I must go seek another
Service."</p>

<p>"Another Service?" repeated he, with
a yet more piercing Look.&mdash;"This is
strange ... and sudden. We thought
you were so happy."</p>

<p>"I was," said I. "Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?" And he waited: but
I spake never a Word mo'.</p>

<p>"I see how it is!" cried he, suddenly
growing red, "Master <i>Groggett</i> hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
tempted thee away from me, with Promise
of higher Salary. Pitiful Fellow!
I wot he hath long envied me a faithful
Servant. 'Tis against our Company's
Ordinance, to tempt a Man from his
Master! Go, however, since thou wilt,
ungrateful Youth!&mdash;thy Fidelity hath
been undermined; thou hast never apprized
our Kindness, hast never loved
us!"</p>

<p>This unloosed my Tongue, and I said,
"I have felt, if I have not deserved your
Kindness, Master <i>Hewet</i>. No one hath
tempted, nor could tempt me away, and
I but seek to go for that I love you e'en
too well."</p>

<p>"How can you love us too well?"
quod he distrustfully.</p>

<p>&mdash;"<i>One</i> of you," I said, faltering.</p>

<p>"<i>Anne</i>?" cried he. And saw it in my
Face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
&mdash;"Well, Lad," quod he, softer, "no
Need to blush scarlet nor weep, where
no Shame lieth. <i>That</i> would be in <i>not</i>
loving her, I think. You may love too
much, you can't love too well."</p>

<p>"Too well for my Peace," quod I,
turning my Head away&mdash;"You had better
let me go."</p>

<p>"Well, I think not," quod he, after a
Pause of some Length. "Go to what?
To another House, where Everything
will be worse for thee, save that <i>Anne</i>
will be not only out of Reach but out
of Sight. You must perforce conquer
yourself <i>then</i>, you know. Try to conquer
yourself <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can," I said; so
huskily, that he made me repeat it
twice.</p>

<p>"You meant to try, I suppose," quod
he, "when you spake of going away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
"Yes, Master."</p>

<p>"Well, try here:&mdash;for a little While,
that I may think where to place you.
<i>Ned!</i>&mdash;I have had some Trial of thee;
I have tested thee, and I have trusted
thee. Don't betray my Trust in this
Matter."</p>

<p>I said, "I will not."</p>

<p>"And do thou," quod he, with all his
old Kindness, "trust in me. I shall do
what, on Deliberation, I think best for
you. And stay thyself with this Reflection:
that if thou wert the first
Noble in the Land, sueing for my
Daughter, I would not, in these her
so early Days, give her to thee. Keep
a brave, honest Heart, and take Things
quietly. You have not been such a
Knave as to speak to her?"</p>

<p>"No, Master."</p>

<p>"Your Word is enough," quod he, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
left me. I put my Head down on mine
Arms and shed hot Tears that had no
Relief in them. Just then, I felt a kind
Hand laid with strong emphatic Pressure
on my Shoulder. I kissed it, in Sign of
Reverence and Good-faith: he understood
it for such, and left me without a Word.
And I went on mine Affairs with a
lightened Heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />&nbsp;<i>Master Hewet ordereth Things discretely</i></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="100" height="102" alt="T"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Two</span>
Days after this, Master
<i>Hewet</i> sent me to <i>Antwerp</i>.
I abode there six Months,
transacting his Affairs.
There was much to learn,
much to see. When I returned Home, it
was with a strong Heart. Directly I saw
Mistress <i>Anne</i>, I felt that I loved her as
much as ever; but I also felt that I could
rule myself. She cried, "Oh, <i>Osborne</i>,
thou art returned at last! How glad I
am!" with her dear, innocent Eyes fixed
brightly on mine; and forthwith began
to tell me that one of her Dormice had
died, and to ask me to get her another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
I told her I had brought her a Guinea-pig;
she thanked me, but said she did
not think she should like it as much as
the Dormouse.</p>

<p>I found that some Change in Household
Arrangements had been made in
mine Absence, whereby my old Quarters
were pre-occupied; and that Master
<i>Hewet</i> had taken a Lodging for me at the
Barbitonsor's over the Way; where, in
Sooth, both Master <i>Soper</i> and the young
Women failed not in Aught that should
be for my Comfort, and at very reasonable
Charges. Howbeit, an Alarm of Housebreakers
soon recalled me to mine old
Post again, save that I had the Attick in
Place of the Loft; every Woman in the
House thinking it safe with me and unsafe
without me. And Master <i>Hewet</i> said
I made the old Place look more like
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
Now, mark me, <i>Hew</i>! Thus went I
on <i>for three whole Years</i>, and ne'er once
lost Hold of my Stay. What Man hath
done, Man may do. I was not like one
working on Hope, for I had had none
given me. I say not that I was always
borne up to High-water Mark. Questionless,
there were daily Ebbs and Flows;
and ever and anon, a mighty, powerful,
rushing Wind would come, and drive
back the Current on an Heap, leaving
bare the stony Channel; till after a While,
with strong Recoil, it came hurrying
back, ready to sweep all before it. But,
<i>I never let go the Rope</i>! Many Waters
cannot quench Love, neither can the
Floods drown it. Deep might call
hoarsely unto Deep, but not prevail....</p>

<p>Speak as if I felt it? Why, I <i>do</i>!
I am an oldish Man now, at least you
think me not over young; but there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
some good and pure Feelings, Lad, thou
wilt never become dull to, so long as
thou keepest thy Heart with all Diligence.
And the best of it is, that whilst
those Feelings, so far as they were pleasant,
are pleasant still, the Pains, then so
bitter, that came from keeping down all
that was wrong with a strong Hand, are
now Pleasures too!&mdash;that are recalled
over and over again: when, maybe, we
seem cogitating or dozing. Give me thy
Hand, Lad: I see you believe me.</p>

<p>So did Master <i>Hewet</i> believe me. We
were, I fancy, often thinking at the same
Time of the same Matter; but thereof
spake we none. I was not watched;
neither did he make a Shew of not
watching me: only gave me daily Proofs
of a deepening and enlarging Confidence.
I heard him say one Day to one of his
fellow Aldermen, ere the Door was well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
closed behind me, "It were a poor Word,
Master <i>Bowyer</i>, to say I could trust that
young Man with untold Gold."</p>

<p>But those Ebbs and Flows I spake of
... sometimes they arose from mine own
unmanageable Thoughts, I wist not why
nor wherefore; sometimes from the Approach
of this or that Suitor ... for,
towards the End of the Term I named,
there were full many, I promise you;
though, for the most Part, not dangerous
ones: sometimes from Mistress <i>Anne</i> herself,
who began to have <i>her</i> Ebbs and Flows
too, both of Spirits and Temper; and who,
when some of her Suitors, more unpleasing
unto her than the Rest, did make Suit
to her with Over-boldness, would become
pettish and captious, not only with them
but with me and with every one else.</p>

<p>In one of these little Humours, she
accused me of being less regardful of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
pleasing her than any one in the House:
I would do Nothing for her. I said there
was Nothing I would not do. She said
that was fine Talking. I said, Would
she prove me? She was leaning over the
Balcony at the Time; and, looking down
therefrom, said, Would I bring her that
yellow Fumitory that grew in the Cleft
of the Bridge-buttress? I looked at it
and then at her, and said gravely, it could
not be done without imperilling of Life,
but that if she bade me, I would try.
She said, turning red as she spake, she <i>did</i>
bid me. Then I said I would take my
Reward beforehand, as I might not be
fortunate enough to come back. And
kissed her Hand, and the same Instant
was over the Parapet. She cries, "Oh
<i>Edward</i>, stay!" and gives a Scream that
rings through my Ears and makes People
look forth of their Casements. I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
hanging by my two Hands to the Ballusters,
seeking some Ledge for my Foot;
but, seeing her white Face, and knowing
she had sent me on a sinfully reckless
Errand, I, without more Ado, gave a
sudden Spring back into the Balcony.
She meanwhile, in the Buckram-chamber,
had hidden her Face in her Hands, and
was weeping bitterly. I was never so
near losing Command of myself as that
Time.</p>

<p>'Twould amuse thee&mdash;it amuses me,&mdash;to
pass in Review all her Suitors of that
Season. There was Master <i>Bolsover</i>, the
Merchant-tailor&mdash;young <i>Bowes</i>, the Goldsmith,
Son of Sir <i>Martin</i>&mdash;<i>Guy Burrell</i>,
the Clothworker;&mdash;pretty near all the
great Companies, except the Fishmongers',
had their Representative, I think.&mdash;Then,
for the Court, there were <i>Ralph de Cobham</i>,
a Spendthrift, <i>Lancelyn Ferrars</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
a sixth Cousin of the <i>Percies</i>. These
all came and went, like Players in a
Droll.</p>

<p>Meantime, I came and went, too; ...
to <i>Leeds</i>, to <i>Halifax</i>, to <i>Norwich</i>, to <i>Stratford</i>;
and again to <i>Cales</i>, <i>Abbeville</i>, and
<i>Antwerp</i>. Master <i>Hewet</i> supplied me
with plenty of Money, and kept me
abroad longer than before. I had Time
to look at Pictures and Churches, and to
learn to speak the Tongues of the Countries
I abode in with some Fluency. I
had Introductions to Merchants of the
Staple, among whom were Men as
friendly and enlightened as any I ever
knew.</p>

<p>When I learned that Queen <i>Mary</i> had
deceased, and that our gracious Lady
<i>Elizabeth</i> was set on the Throne in her
Stead, I thought it hard to be still kept
from Home, where Terror and Tears had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
now given Place to Joy and Gladness.
Howbeit, Master <i>Hewet</i> would still keep
me Abroad, on some Affairs that seemed
of less Moment to me than they did to
him.</p>

<p>I set my Face towards <i>England</i> at last,
with a greater Longing for Home than
I had ever had before. That Home was
now changed: Master <i>Hewet</i> had removed
into a goodly Mansion in <i>Philpot
Lane</i>, fit for a Merchant Prince, and
plainly yet nobly furnished. His Household
was also increased by the Addition
of several new Servants; but the House
on the Bridge was still his House of
Business.</p>

<p>I know not when I had so desired to
see his Face, and to breathe the same
Air with Mistress <i>Anne</i>. I hastened to
<i>Philpot Lane</i>, and the first Sound I heard
on entering the House, was of a Lute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
rarely touched. I stood at Pause and
listened with Rapture. I thought, Oh,
what heaven-like Sounds! how sweet an
Air! how greatly hath she improved!
when, of a sudden, the Prelude, for 'twas
no more, was succeeded by a lovesick
Ballad, sung by a <i>Man's</i> mellow Voice!
Oh, my Heart seemed to leap to my
Lips, so great was the Revulsion. I
staggered as though I were shrew-struck;
and leaning against the Wall, tried to
deafen my Ears to the hateful Sound.
How all the sweet Chords seemed jangled!
Who was the Singer? and what was his
Footing here?</p>

<p>While I put to myself these bootless
Questions, the Door at the Stair-head
opened, Voices spake Farewell, some one
came forth, a light Foot ran down the
Stair, and, or ever I was aware, or could
move off, a very young Man, habited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
in russet Damask and blue embroidered
Satin, handsome and of lordly Bearing,
nearly ran over me. Looking forth of
the House-door, he turned about again
and said to me abruptly, "Canst tell me
where are my People?"</p>

<p>I made Answer, "I know not your
People's Liveries, my Lord," (for I felt
assured he was a Nobleman,) "but I saw
a Party of Men in watchet Coats, with
a spotted Dog on their Badges, at the
Lane-end."</p>

<p>"All right," quod he, and proffered
me a Piece of Money with a good-natured
Air; but I drew back, on which
he looked surprised, gave me a second
Look, slightly bent his Head, and went
forth.</p>

<div class="image-center">
  <img src="images/267-img.jpg" width="400" height="551" alt="004"/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="small cursive">J J</p>
    <p class="cursive">"Proferred me a Piece of Money"</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I saw he had offered me a Gift, mistaking
my Degree; but what I could
not help chiefly noting was, the exceeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
smallness of the Coin. I marvelled
so fine a young Gentleman could proffer
so mean a Gift. "Ah," thought I, "'tis
the City Wealth brings these Gallants
so far east. A Bag of Gold would be
as welcome to them tied round the
Neck of <i>Damaris</i> as of sweet Mistress
<i>Anne</i>. 'Tis for their own Ends they
hawk low, like a Swift for a Dragonfly."</p>

<p>Then I leaned against the Wall for
a Moment, and said within myself, "O
God, I have Everything that is dear
to me at Stake. However my Patience
may be tried, yet make me patient, I
beseech thee: I know it is the Thing
of all others in which I am most to
seek; yet let me, as at this Time,
struggle with myself not in vain, O
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>."</p>

<p>Then I ran nimbly up-stairs, into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
pleasant Summer-chamber the young
Lord had just left. Therein found I
Mistress <i>Anne</i>, hanging in a thoughtful
Posture, over a Posy of rare Flowers on
the Table. Starting when she saw me, she
said, "Oh, <i>Osborne</i>, is it you?" and blushed.</p>

<p>I stood at Pause, without a Word to
proffer. Quod she, "I am glad thou
art safe returned&mdash;hast thou seen my
Father?" I said, "No, Mistress.
Have you fared quite well since I
left?" She saith, "Quite well." Then
I said, "What rare Flowers! shall I
bring you some Water for them?"
"No," quod she carelessly, "they are
scarce worth the keeping." "Scarce
worth the keeping!" quod I, "nay,
they are not such as are to be bought
in a <i>London</i> Herb-market.... Divers
of them, these Coronations for Example,
must have come from far." "They all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
come from far," quod she, "but what
of that? I like them none the better."
And commenced pulling a Gilly-flower
to Pieces. I said, "I am glad I am not
that Gilly-flower." She saith, "Why?"
But I made no Answer, for how witted
I that I was any better prized? So I
turned to go; and just as I gained the
Door, I heard her softly say, "<i>Edward!</i>"
Then I stayed. She saith, "You will
find my Father in his Closet;" and so,
passed me with the Flowers in her Hand;
and I saw that her Eyes were full of
Tears ready to shed. When she was
gone, I went back and took up some of
the Gilly-flower Leaves she had scattered,
and kissed them. Just then enters
Master <i>Hewet</i> from his Closet beyond,
wherein he might ha' heard every Word
had been said; but there was Nought to
be shamed of, if he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
He saith, "<i>Ned!</i> I am glad to see thee,
Lad! How well thou look'st! And
yet, now I observe thee more narrowly,
thou look'st amiss. Hath Aught gone
wrong? Nay then, that's well. Methinks,
with thine Allowance, thou
mightest go a little braver; which is
what few young Men need the egging
on to ... and yet thou gracest whatsoe'er
thou hast on."</p>

<p>Then he told me what he called the
grand News of the Day&mdash;my Lord <i>Talbot's</i>
Suit to Mistress <i>Anne</i>. I said, "Oh!
Master, don't kill me," and hid my
Face in my Hands. He saith, "Why,
<i>Ned</i>, whom am I saving her for, but
<i>you</i>? Look up, Boy! He that did
save, the same shall have! I have but
one Child, and I mean to make her
happy. But mark me, <i>Ned</i>, I wot not
whether that is to be done by giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
her unto mine adopted Son; nor, peradventure,
art thou any more assured of
it. Woo her then, Lad, with my free
Consent, but tell her not just yet, that
thou hast it. My Fancy&mdash;a strange
one, maybe&mdash;is to see what she will in
that Case do."</p>

<p>I knelt, and caught his Hand to my
Lips.</p>

<p>"Thy Father's own Son," quod he
smiling, "he had the darker Beard, thou
hast the better Eye. Thou art a Gentleman's
Son, and I am no more. Start
fair with the young Lord; he dines
with me to-day, and so shalt thou.
And now, be off with thee."</p>

<p>I passed forth into the Stretes, not
heeding in what Direction, for my Brain
was a-fire, and I wanted to quiet it and
to think over many Things&mdash;no Place for
Solitariness like the Stretes! Then I returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
to my old Quarters on the Bridge,
and looked out a Suit I had bought and
wore once at <i>Antwerp</i>, but had thought
almost too fine for Home, albe but little
garnished ... to wit, of murray-colour,
overlaid with a good silk Lace; and a
<i>Mechlin</i> Edge and Tassels to my Bands.
Thought I, peradventure the 'Prentice in
his blue Gown had most reason to be
proud of his Favour ... she kissed me
then, when she could scarce hold on by
my Hair, 'twas so short; and now it
might wind twice round her Finger....
Then I went across to Master <i>Soper</i>, and
quod I, "Now, Master Tonsor, thou
must trim me for a Feast; but, mark
me, mine Hair was cut last in <i>Flanders</i>,
where they trim the Hair little and the
Beard close; so follow the Lead and
keep the foreign Fashion, and I'll give
thee Twopence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
"Marry come up," muttered he, "what
Airs these Youngsters bring from over
Seas!" And I felt I was in his power,
and that one malicious snip might put
me past Redress; howbeit, he stayed
himself with less Work, more Pay, and
acquitted himself handsomely. Then I
took my <i>Flemish</i> Beaver, and my new
Cloke across my Arm, and sallied forth;
and chancing to look back, was avised of
<i>Tryphena</i> and <i>Tryphosa</i> leaning forth of
their upper Casement to look after me.
Being caught at which, they disappeared.</p>

<p>As I entered the House, I heard Mistress
<i>Fraunces</i> say to <i>Damaris</i>, "Be sure
they spoil not the Mortreuse," which
avised me we were to have state. Howbeit,
there was a rich plainness in Everything;
the parcel-gilt double Salt-cellar
and chased Flagons alone calling Attention
to their Cost. And though Everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
set on Table was far-fetched and of
the best, far exceeding the Tables of the
best Merchants in <i>Antwerp</i>, we had not
too much nor too many of any Thing.
I could not note that Mistress <i>Anne</i> had
made any Difference for him&mdash;a few
Strings of Pearls were warped into her
Hair, and she ware her mouse-coloured
Velvet, which she never thought too fine,
with or without Company; but no Posy.
Two Men with <i>Talbot</i> Badges helped
Master <i>Hewet's</i> Men to wait; my Lord
sat next Mistress <i>Anne</i>, and I over-against
them. As we took our Places, he seemed
to remember my Face, and to be surprised
at my sitting down with him;
which Master <i>Hewet</i> noting, in a certain
haughtiness in his Air, he saith, "Mine
adopted Son, my Lord, and the Son of
mine earliest Friend.... We are all
plain People, but the <i>Osbornes</i> as good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
as any here sitting, saving your Lordship's
Presence." Whereon, my Lord,
recovering, pledged me.</p>

<p>Now, Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> was so abashed
at entertaining an Earl's Son, as that
she lost all her natural Easiness, and
could bethink her of Nothing to say but
to ask him ever and anon, whether he
liked what he ate, which he professed to
do once and again, though I believe he
scarce marked the Difference of one Dish
from another. For the first Time, I
learned what the fair Speech of Lordlings
to Ladies is made of ... it seemed to me
rather a flimsy Stuff, Warp and Woof;
over-stretched and loose-wove. Then
Master <i>Hewet</i>, to leave him and <i>Anne</i> to
themselves, kept up a By-talk with me
about <i>Flanders</i>; drawing forth of me
not so much about the Staple as about
the Country, Towns, Rivers, Houses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
Churches, and People. I had been to
<i>Nürnberg</i>, and could tell him of the
mighty Works of Genius produced by
the Artists of the free Imperial City, and
of the Wealth and Splendour of its Merchants.
Mistress <i>Fraunces</i> was afterwards
pleased to say I took the Colour out of the
young Lord: what she intended thereby
I never clearly made out&mdash;peradventure,
being a Woman, she meant I was brown
and red, and he pink and white; for
indeed I was sore sunburned. For good
Looks, there was no Fault to find in my
Lord: he had that Easiness of Carriage
and Manner which I think none but
young Lords have. He took not much
upon him, considering what he was and
with whom; and, for the Rest, he was
pleasant, but not bright. His Hands
were womanish for Softness, and I heard
from <i>Damaris</i>, who had it from his Men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
that one Reason thereof was, he never
washed them in cold Water, only dabbed
them a little with a soft Napkin. Methought,
rather than that, I would choose
my Hands of a little coarser Grain. I
think he parleyed for a Quarter of an
Hour on the Christian Names of his
Ancestry, how the Heads of his House
had been alternately a <i>Richard</i> and a
<i>Gilbert</i>, a <i>Richard</i> and a <i>Gilbert</i>, for I
wot not how many Generations; and
then how the Name of <i>George</i> got in,
and then of <i>Frauncis</i>, and how he was a
<i>George</i> again ... flimsy Talk and tedious.
Mistress <i>Anne</i> sate wondrous quiet, and
once gave me, across the Table, such a
Look! Methought if she were secretly
amusing herself, I had no Need to be so
jealous unto Death as I felt.</p>

<p>When my Lord took Leave, he, to my
Surprise, invited me to attend him a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
Way. I looked at him, to be assured
there was no Mistake; and, seeing he
awaited me, I followed; Master <i>Hewet</i>
saying as I departed, "Fail not to look in
on us as thou returnest." In the open
Air, my Lord and I walked awhile without
speaking, by Reason of the People we
met; but, proceeding to a side Aisle of
<i>Paul's</i>, he spake to me of this and that, I
following his Lead, and leaving him to
start his Subject.</p>

<p>At length, quod he, "Master <i>Hewet</i>
lives quietly ... they that save most,
shew least; ha, Master <i>Osborne</i>?" I
coolly replied, "My Lord, it may be so."&mdash;"A
rich Man," pursued he, "like a
Prophet, may have least Honour in his
own Street and his own House. Why
now, there may be many cross daily his
Threshold and have Speech of him on
ordinary Affairs, that wot not he, for as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
homely as he is, hath six thousand
Pounds by the Year ... am I within
the Mark, Master <i>Osborne</i>?" "Marry,
my Lord," quod I, "your honourable
Lordship seemeth to know much more
of the Secrets of his strong Box than I
do. I never yet asked of him what it
held, nor never was told." "That may
be true," quod he, "and yet you may
guess."&mdash;"But I never did guess," interrupted
I, "I know him for rich, and
liberal, and of high Credit at Home and
Abroad; and that is all." "You would
surprise me," quod my Lord, "unless it
were clear to me that you resent my
Freedom with you in this Matter."
"On my Faith, my Lord," quod I, "I
resent Nothing. I may know the
Amount and Success of this or that
Venture of Master <i>Hewet's</i>, without
having any Key to the Sum total of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
Wealth; but whatever came to my
Knowledge, whether by Chance, by
Confidence, or in the Way of Business,
it is certain I should keep locked in my
Heart as faithfully as his Trade Secrets
what Time I was his 'Prentice."
"Nay, you are a good and honest Heart,"
quod my Lord. "Be as honourable to
me as to him, I beseech you, and say
Nothing that shall minish me in his
good Liking." "Why should I, my
good Lord?" quod I, "our Paths lie
wide enough asunder." "Aye, but you
have his Ear," quod he, "in the Way
of daily Business, and he spake of you
as his adopted Son. If you are as a
Son unto him, his Daughter is unto you
as a Sister, and you may do a good
Turn for me, peradventure, with fair
Mistress <i>Anne</i>." "My Lord," quod I,
"we are on quite a different Footing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
from what you suppose, and your Suit
would gain no better Favour from
passing through my Hands." "Will
you try that?" quod he, smiling.
"Marry, my Lord, why should you put
it upon me?" quod I, "you are far
better able to make Suit for yourself ...
Earls' Sons do not commonly seek in
vain for fair Ladies' Favour."... "You
will, at least, not be my Foe?" quod he.
"No, my Lord," quod I, "unless you
give me greater Reason to be than you
have done yet: howbeit, I marvel your
Lordship should value my good or ill
Favour at a Pin's Purchase."</p>

<p>"Ah," quod he, after a Pause, during
which we paced half the Length of the
Aisle, "there be some Things that neither
Rank nor Money can buy; and I saw
that Mistress <i>Anne</i> had you in her
Regard."&mdash;"Did you, my Lord?" cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
I, "wherein did she shew it?" But he
was thinking of his own Matters rather
than of mine, therefore only said, "I
could discern it and am assured of it;
therefore be my good Friend, good
<i>Osborne</i>, and speak a good Word for me
when you can."</p>

<p>Then taking a Ring off his Finger, he
saith, "I beseech you, accept this Ruby
for the Esteem I bear unto you ... a
mere Trifle, yet a good Stone, I assure
you&mdash;nay, Sir, be not so unkindly&mdash;'beseech
you, for my Love."</p>

<p>I put it aside, saying, "In a Word, my
Lord, I cannot. Faith, it were well
your honourable Lordship would turn
into another Aisle, for there is a Tailor
behind yonder Pillar taking down the
Particulars of your Apparel in his Notebook,
which 'twere Pity o' my Life,
for the excellent Devising thereof,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
should be copied and sold in a City
Frippery."</p>

<p>He moved off with a Start and a Smile,
replacing his Ring. At the same Time
we were accosted by one of those habitual
Frequenters of <i>Paul's Walk</i>, that will sue
your Charity first, and pick your Pocket
afterwards. My Lord affected first not to
hear him, but seeing me feel for a Trifle
to be quit of him, he sought his own
Purse, which, not finding, he turned
about in some Anxiety to his Men, who
were some Way behind, and accosted
them as soon as they came up, with
"Here, <i>Cresswell</i>, <i>Jenkyn</i>! I have lost my
Purse,&mdash;hie back, one of you, to Master
<i>Hewet's</i>, where, methinks, I dropped
it." "My Lord, I will return and aid
in the Search," quod I, glad of an
Excuse for ending so troublesome a Dialogue;
albeit I thought it much more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
likely he had lost his Purse in the Place
we were in than dropped it at our House.</p>

<p>However, there I was wrong, for
<i>Damaris</i> met us on our Return, saying,
"Oh yes, here is my Lord's Purse," and
gave it unto his Man. When she had
watched him depart, "'Twas hardly
worth returning for," quod she disdainfully,
"there were but three Nobles; and
albeit the Purse had a Hole in't, 'twas
not big enow for a Penny-piece to
drop through. But peradventure he was
ashamed we should see it, so was anxious
to have it back." "There's no Shame
in Poverty, <i>Damaris</i>," quod I, "if we
are not proud with it."&mdash;"Nay, I know
not," quod she, doubtfully; "Folks
always <i>are</i> ashamed of it, that's certain."</p>

<p>In the withdrawing Chamber sate Mistress
<i>Anne</i> at her Needle, beside Master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
<i>Hewet</i> in his great Chair. "Now then,"
thought I, "every good Angel be my
speed! I believe I can tell as well as
most whether a Man be only setting
himself to sleep, or verily and indeed
sleeping; and I see that at this present,
Master <i>Hewet</i> is truly and soundly asleep,
but yet his being at his Daughter's Side
gives me Freedom of Access unto her I
should not in other Wise enjoy, and will
now neither abuse nor neglect."</p>

<p>So, without a second Thought, and
armed with my Possession of the Father's
private Grace, I sate down over-against
her. She said, "So soon returned?" and
began to question me of my Travel.
Then my Tongue unloosed, and I told
her how many fair Things I had seen,
how many notable People and Places, yet
how none of these had been able to damp
for one Moment my Desire to be at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
Home, within Sight and Sound of her.
As I went on, waxing more and more
fluent, more and more passionate, so did
her Colour wax deeper and deeper, until,
with a Look of extreme Displeasure and
Aversion, she said, "<i>Edward</i>, thou art
beside thyself ... pray let me never
more hear such foolish Talk as this&mdash;I
had better Thoughts of thee." And
arose to go. I arose too, and stayed her,
and prayed her to forgive me if I had
spoken Aught amiss,&mdash;if she did not, I
could have no Peace. She said, "I cannot
just now, I am wounded so much;"
and went away, with flushed Cheeks and
Eyes full of Tears. Master <i>Hewet</i> was
roused by her Departure, and, rubbing his
Eyes, smiled and said, "I thought <i>Anne</i>
had been here." "She is but just
gone," I made Answer; and the rest of
the Evening was sad enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
Next Day, I had long Speech of Master
<i>Hewet</i>, touching foreign Affairs. He
told me of this and that Estate in <i>Yorkshire</i>
he had been buying, in the Parishes
of <i>Wales</i> and <i>Hartshill</i>, and of his minding
to send me down to see them, if I were
ready to start off again so soon. I said,
"I am quite ready, Sir." "Shortly thou
shalt go, then," quod he. "And now
take up these Letters to <i>Anne</i>, for they
concern her more than me, being
Thanks from some of her poor Pensioners."
Adding, just as I was leaving,
"Thou didst not make much way last
Night, <i>Ned</i> ..." and smiled; which
bewrayed to me that he had heard at
least Part of what was said; which I was
mad with him for, and thought not fair.</p>

<p>And now I began to muse within myself
what a provoking Thing it was, that
when all the Obstacles I had counted insurmountable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
between <i>Anne</i> and me had
suddenly given Way, I should be brought
up short by herself! Certes, an' she
cared not for me, there was no more to
be said; and Master <i>Hewet</i> would in no
Ways be to blame if he gave her to
Somebody else; neither had I ever sought
nor had she ever bestowed any such
Tokens of especial and considerable Regard
as should encourage me to suppose
I had only to ask and have. And yet,
I had somehow always thought, "Only
give me my fair Chance with the Rest,
and I ask for nothing better." That
was my Conceit and Presumption. Therefore
with a very sad and sorry Aspect did
I carry up the Letters to Mistress <i>Anne</i>,
and used as few Words as need be in the
delivering of them. She on her Part
was equally dry, and gave me no Pretence
to tarry, and yet I lingered. Seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
which, and that I was about to speak,
(though I protest, on Somewhat quite as
trivial as the Weather,) she suddenly
coloured up very much and said, "<i>Edward</i>,
if you are going to talk any
more Nonsense, as you did last Night,
I would rather go away." "There's no
Need, Madam," said I coolly, "I had
not such a Thought in my Head."
On which she coloured still worse, and
sitting down again began to read her
Letters.</p>

<p><i>Damaris</i> now came in, and began to
stitch away at a distant Window. "I
have but to say Farewell, Mistress
<i>Anne</i>," quod I, "before I start on my
next Journey." "So soon again? where
are you going?" quod she, without
looking up from her Letters. "A rolling
Stone gathers no Moss." (This was an
unkind Cut, considering her own Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
set me rolling.) "To <i>Yorkshire</i>," replied
I, "and perhaps I had best say Farewell
at once, for Lord <i>Talbot</i> is coming in at
the Gate."</p>

<p>"Oh then, <i>Edward</i>, stay!" cries she
with all her old Frankness: starting up
and dropping her Letters. As we both
stooped to pick them up, I said, "I will,
if you wish it; but are you assured you
know your own Mind?" "Quite,"
said she very determinately, "so leave
me not by any Means."</p>

<p>Then cometh in my Lord, very brave,
in blue Silk and Silver. How laughable
it was, if I could but have felt merry!
<i>Damaris</i>, questionless, was laughing in
her Sleeve. My Lord steps up to Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, with easy Assuredness, and
touches with his Lips a very pretty Fabrick
of Silk rayed with Silver, for she
gave him a gloved Hand. Then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
hoped she had rested better than he had,
as in Sooth he saw by her divine Looks
she must needs have done; and he marvelled
not that Roses were at no Price to
be had just now at Court, since 'twas
plain they found a more nourishing Soil
in the City; and so forth, like a Valentine,
calling her Looks Nature's sweetest
Books, her Tresses golden Meshes, her
Voice Musick, her Favour Heaven, with
Apostrophes to <i>Venus</i> and <i>Cupid</i>, and
Asseverations that he was a Prey to a
Mind delighting in Sorrow, Spirits wasted
with Passion, a Heart torn in Pieces with
Care. To which she made Answer, that
she hoped he overstated his ill Condition.
To which he responded that if he did,
'twas <i>error amoris</i>, not <i>amor erroris</i>. With
othermuch i' the same Vein, that he cared
no Whit for mine hearing, but rather
enjoyed having another Listener while he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
ran off Phrases that it seemed to me he
must needs have got by Heart. I thought,
As she liketh not my Fashion, maybe she
liketh this. Howbeit, there was Nothing
in her Favour to discover whether she
did or no. So after a set Time given to
this Court-like Parry and Thrust, this
Quip and Compliment, whereby I wist
not how a Man could suppose his Suit
moved one Way or the other, my Lord
takes leave with easy Grace, as a Man
who had, in one Affair, transacted the
Business of the Day to his Satisfaction.</p>

<p>So soon as he hath departed, Mistress
<i>Anne</i> falls a laughing, when in cometh
Master <i>Hewet</i>, looking somewhat harassed;
seeing which, <i>Damaris</i> sweeps up
her Work and departs, leaving us all with
grave Faces.</p>

<p>"<i>Nan</i>," quoth Master <i>Hewet</i>, casting
himself into his Arm-chair, "I must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
a few Words with thee of this Suitor
of thine."</p>

<p>"We are not alone, <i>Father</i>," interrupted
Mistress <i>Anne</i>, casting a quick,
apprehensive Look towards me.</p>

<p>"Tilly-valley," he responded, "none
other is within Earshot of us but <i>Ned
Osborne</i>, who is only an <i>alter ego</i>."</p>

<p>"He may be thine, <i>Father</i>, but he is
not mine," quod Mistress <i>Anne</i>, somewhat
captiously, "and I pray you to defer
what you have to say to me till we are
by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Maiden, thou art over-hasty," quod
Master <i>Hewet</i>, looking fixedly at her,
"and, in thy Fear of being over-civil
unto one who has been unto thee as a
Brother, and to whom, moreover, thou
owest thy Life, art somewhat failing in
good Manners."</p>

<p>Her Eye sank before his, and she submissively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
replied, "Well, then, <i>Father</i>,
what is it thou wouldest say?"</p>

<p>"Just this," he returned, "whether
Lord or Commoner, the Youth must
have an Answer, so soon as thou
knowest thine own Mind."</p>

<p>"I know it already," quod Mistress
<i>Anne</i>, shortly.</p>

<p>"What is it?" saith her Father. She
faltered for a Moment,&mdash;"Not to have
him," she replied softly.</p>

<p>"<i>Ned</i>, thou hast thine Answer," quod
Master <i>Hewet</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>, Sir?" quod I, starting.</p>

<p>"Hear'st thou not?" returned he imperturbably,
"thou hast it from herself.
I told thee I but sought to make my
only Child happy,&mdash;you can't make her
so, it seemeth,&mdash;she won't have you."</p>

<p>"<i>Father!</i> what <i>are</i> you saying?" cried
Mistress <i>Anne</i>, trembling exceedingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
He looked at her, but made no
Answer.</p>

<p>"Were you not," said she, leaning
over him breathlessly, her Dress vibrating
with the quick beating of her Heart,&mdash;"were
you not making Question of
Lord <i>Talbot</i>?"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Lord <i>Talbot</i>? Lord <i>Marlingspike</i>!"&mdash;quod
he, "my Thoughts were as far
from him as from the City Giants!
Said I not 'this Suitor of thine'?
Whom should I think of but <i>Ned
Osborne</i>?"</p>

<p>"You never told me before, that <i>I</i>
might," quod she, turning scarlet, and
then bursting into Tears. I sprang towards
her, but she brake away from me,
and was gone in a Moment. Master
<i>Hewet</i> leaned back in his Chair and
smiled. "Methinks, <i>Ned</i>," quod he,
"the Day is thine, this Time." And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
taking the Ring off his Finger, that he
had shown Lord <i>Howard</i> of <i>Effingham</i> on
the Bridge, "See," quod he, "how long I
have destined her for thee!"</p>

<p>&mdash;Here 'tis, <i>Hew</i>&mdash;I always wear it
now. Thou mark'st the Posy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse quote">"He that did save,</div>
  <div class="verse">The same shall have."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;Many a goodly Hereditament had I
with her, too ... the <i>Barking</i> Estate,
and those <i>Yorkshire</i> Lands inclusive. The
<i>Settings</i> of my Ring, Lad! no more&mdash;the
Casket that went with my Treasure&mdash;the
binding of my Book.</p>

<p>So now thou seest how thou mayest
wait a little longer for fair Mistress
<i>Joyeuse</i>, without fuming and chafing, lest
this Hurt, got in a good Cause, should
lose thee thy Place among thy Rivals.
Tut, Lad, 'twill only grace thee in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
Eyes all the more! See how Things
came round in my Case. I had not half
thy good Favour, nor the brightness that
a Sword carrieth in a Woman's Eyes.
"A plain Man, dwelling in Tents...."
Nothing more!</p>

<p>Well, what remains to tell? We married,
we were happy? Thou knowest it,
and yet sayest, "Go on." <i>Anne</i> and I
were married early in the <i>October</i> of that
Year; and on the <i>29th</i> of that same
Month, Master <i>Hewet</i> was chosen Lord
<i>Mayor</i> of <i>London</i>, and knighted at <i>Westminster</i>.
What a Pageant we got up for
him! I was a young Husband, full of
Spirits, and ready for Anything that came
in my Way, Feasting or Fighting; in
special, then, to do Honour to him unto
whom, under Heaven, I owed all earthly
Good. So I took Council with the
Master-revellers; and, between us, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
concocted as pretty a Subtlety as ever
was devised! Don't laugh, Sirrah! you'd
have thought it very fine. There was
the Symbol of our Mystery, a Golden
Ram, ridden by a little Child, cherub-like
for Beauty, followed by rustical Shepherds
and Shepherdesses with Pipes and Tabors
and flower-wreathed Crooks. Then came
the Players of the Pageant, which was
the Story of <i>Apollo</i> keeping the Flocks
of <i>Admetus</i>, and helping him to win his
fair Wife; all which was to be enacted
at the proper Time on a goodly Stage
representing a pastoral Wilderness, with
Trees, Bushes, Shrubs, Brambles, and
Thickets, interspersed with Birds and
Beasts. In the Midst, <i>Apollo</i> playing on
his Lyre: on either Side a Satyr, mopping,
mowing, and curvetting. This was,
as you may plainly perceive, altogether
diverse from and very superior to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
Drapers' tasteless Pageant of <i>Salisbury
Plain</i>, whereon were assembled Shepherds,
Shepherdesses, Carders, Spinners,
Dyers, Wool-combers, Shermen, Dressers,
Fullers, Weavers, without any Order or
Propriety.</p>

</div>

<p>Ours was of another guess Sort, Sir!
I fancy there was some little Classicality
in it; though I say it that should not.
After the Hall Dinner, ('twas noted of
all how pretty <i>Anne</i>, the young Bride,
looked as Lady Mayoress!) the Players
having set up their Stage, <i>Apollo</i> was
discovered lying all along, a playing of
his Lyre, with his Crook cast aside and
his Sheep scattered hither and thither:
and, quod he,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse quote">"Whoe'er may it gainsay,</div>
  <div class="verse">I am the God of Day;</div>

  <div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></div>
  <div class="verse">Howbeit, 'tis my Fate,</div>
  <div class="verse">Thus cast from high Estate,</div>
  <div class="verse">In these poor Weeds to keep</div>
  <div class="verse">The good Admetus' Sheep."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;And so forth, explaining why he had
been banished from Heaven by <i>Jupiter</i>.
Entereth to him <i>Admetus</i>, not wisting
who he is, beyond his hired Servant,
whereon they parley on Things in general,
especially the Wool Trade and Clothworking,
(with a Hit, here and there,
at the Drapers.) Then the merry Sound
of Drumes and Pfiffes causeth them to
step aside behind the Trees, and there
entereth a Company of Shepherds and
Shepherdesses singing the Praises of their
fair Lady <i>Alcestis</i>, represented by a fair
Boy i' the Midst, crowned with Guirlands.
Then <i>Admetus</i> doeth <i>Apollo</i> to
wit how that he is enamoured of <i>Alcestis</i>,
whose Father will in no wise bestow her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
save on one that shall yoke a Boar and
Lion together in a Car. Then <i>Apollo</i>,
who hath a dark Lanthorn aneath his
Cloke wherewith he ever and anon
maketh a sudden Flare into <i>Admetus'</i>
Eyes, who wisteth not whence it cometh,
nor wotteth 'tis the sunbright Glory of
his celestial Guest, biddeth <i>Admetus</i> not
to lose Heart, for that he will accomplish
his Task for him. And thereupon
taking up his Lyre, he beginneth to
sing and play after such a transporting
Manner, that the Birds give over singing
in the Trees and hop down on his
Shoulders, the Beasts begin to glare at
him through the Thickets, and then to
gather about him, subdued unto a kind
of surly Softness,&mdash;whereon <i>Apollo</i>, giving
<i>Admetus</i> a private Nod and continuing
his playing, <i>Admetus</i> without more Ado
takes a Yoke wreathed with Flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
from one of the Shepherds, yoketh
therewith a Lion and a Boar into a
Car that is presently brought in, placeth
<i>Alcestis</i> in it, driveth her to the Feet
of her Father, (a King,) who arriveth
opportunely and can no longer say why
the Marriage should not be solemnizated;
and, their Hands being joined by him,
the Shepherds and Shepherdesses dance
about them, <i>Apollo</i> still playing; and
one and all chant a Chorus in Praise of
Clothworking.</p>

<p>Ha! that was a notable good Pageant!
Far better than mine own, many Years
after, which I need not tell thee, Lad,
I did not devise myself. The Toy was
pretty, too, and appropriate&mdash;the Story
of <i>Jason</i>, whom I believe to have been
nothing more nor less than a Merchant-adventurer
that equipped his Ship the
<i>Argonaut</i>, and by his Traffic and Commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
carried off the Golden Fleece; that
is to say, the Trade of the World.</p>

<p>Scarce were the Pageants over, and
Master <i>Hewet</i>, that is to say Sir <i>William</i>,
set to his daily and hard Work&mdash;(for a
Lord Mayor, <i>Hew</i>, hath no lazy Time
on't! He presides at the Sittings of
the Court of Aldermen, Common Council,
and Common Hall, is Judge of the <i>London</i>
Sessions at <i>Guildhall</i>, Justice of the Peace
for <i>Southwark</i>, Escheator in <i>London</i> and
<i>Southwark</i>, Conservator of the <i>Thames</i>,
signs notarial Documents, presides at
Public Meetings, founds Charities, is
Trustee for Hospitals, attends the Privy
Council on the Accession of Sovereigns,
and&mdash;not to weary thee with the hearing
of what I've had the doing,&mdash;sits daily
in his own Justice Room by the Space
of four or five Hours). Well, but, to
begin a new Parenthesis, have we not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
had some fine Fellows among us? Look
at <i>Fitz-Alwin</i> resisting one Sovereign,
<i>Walworth</i> defending another, <i>Picard</i> feasting
four Kings at his Table, <i>Philpot</i>
raising a thousand Men at his private
Charges to put down Pirates, <i>Bamne</i> relieving
a great Dearth by importing
foreign Corn, <i>Falconer</i> supplying <i>Henry</i>
the <i>Fifth</i> with the Wherewithal for his
<i>French</i> Wars, <i>Whittington</i> founding Divinity
Lectures and building <i>Newgate</i>, <i>Wells</i> supplying
the City with fresh Water, <i>Eyre</i>
building <i>Leadenhall</i> for a Public Garner,
and bestowing five thousand Marks on the
Poor, <i>Stockton</i> knighted on the Field by
his King for good Service in Battle, <i>Fabian</i>
compiling Chronicles, <i>White</i> founding a
College, and defending our Bridge; and,
not to be farther tedious unto thee, Sir
<i>William Hewet</i>, the Benefactor of every
Hospital, and of the Poor of every Parish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
besides bequeathing a Dowry to every
poor Maid in the Parish of <i>Wales</i> or
<i>Hartshill</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i> that should marry
within a Year of his Decease. These
Men, <i>Hew</i>, were Worthies in their
Generation! And if Master <i>Hewet</i> had
a hard Shrievalty, he had a joyous
Mayoralty, under the early Rays of that
fostering Sun, our glorious Sovereign
Lady <i>Elizabeth</i>!</p>

<p>There is great Peace in the Land. I
say not we are better than we were, but
we are happier and more prosperous.
Sometimes I think those Days of Trial
did us good: they tried us even as Silver
is tried; the baser Metal perished. Let
us not settle on the Lees, lest a worse
Thing come upon us.</p>

value in helping the many to understand a famous Englishman and
the times in which he lived."</p>

<p class="small"><b>Scotsman.</b>&mdash;"This clever work of the historical imagination has
gone through several editions, and is one of the most successful artistic
creations of its kind."</p>

<p class="small"><b>Sketch.</b>&mdash;"In the front rank of the gift-books of the season is this
beautiful and very cleverly illustrated reprint of a work which has lasting
claims to popularity."</p>

<p class="small"><b>Magazine of Art.</b>&mdash;"The grace and beauty of the late Miss
Manning's charming work, 'The Household of Sir Thomas More,'
has been greatly enhanced by the new edition now put forth by Mr.
John C. Nimmo.... This remarkable work is not to be read without
keen delight."</p>

<p class="small"><b>Literary World.</b>&mdash;"It is rare in these days of sensational literature,
when the demand for novels of action is supreme, to take up a book
which is so palpitating with real humanity as this, in which the good and
evil are depicted dividing their power over one heart, and not broadly
separated into heroine and villain."</p>

Miss Manning's most popular work."</p>

pretty."</p>

<p class="small"><b>Sketch.</b>&mdash;"A beautiful book! is the verdict, and one to read and

Defoe's 'Journal of the Plague,' Miss Manning showed not only extraordinary

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
